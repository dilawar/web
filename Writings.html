<h4> Dilawar's Blog</h4>
<p> <b> I have moved this blog from blogspot to wordpress. </b></p>
<a href="http://dilawarrajput.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Here</a>
I keep my late-night thoughts.  Some of these blogs are listed here.
<br>
<br>
I have written about my M. Tech. life here <a
    href="http://wp.me/p2Ob7E-S">Matka (M. Tech. @ IIT Bombay</a> 
</br>
</br>

I felt that Indians' lack of interest in writing well-structured prose is
widespread. Here are some thoughts on it <a
	href="http://dilawarrajput.wordpress.com/2011/08/writing-and-speaking.html">Writing
	and Speaking</a>. I also find their habit of making groups like dogs and
wolves slightly amusing, <a
    href="http://dilawarrajput.wordpress.com/2011/05/privacy--and-secrecy-among-indians.html">Privacy,
	Secrecy and Indians</a>.

</br>
</br>
I am possibly the youngest Nehruvian alive. Nehru, from being a hero in his
time, is now reduced to a zero. See  <a href="http://wp.me/p2Ob7E-16">The Most Unlikely Villain : Jawahar Lal Nehru</a>.
</br>
</br>
There is something about my village <a href="http://dilawarrajput.wordpress.com/2010/04/tale-of-my-village-sort-of.html">Tale of my Vilalge; sort of</a> and about my primary school <a href="http://dilawarrajput.wordpress.com/2010/03/primary-school-nichalpur.html">Primary School Nichalpur.</a>
</br>
</br>
Life of a farmer is always hard and leaving this life is harder <a href="http://dilawarrajput.wordpress.com/2010/10/its-tough-being-in-farming-impossible.html">It tough being in farming, impossible to leave it</a>.
</br>
</br>
Here is a rant on <a
	href="http://wp.me/p2Ob7E-15">Indian
	Middle Class</a>. And also an open letter to <a
	href="http://wp.me/p2Ob7E-q">riches/would-be-riches
	of India.</a>. I am not at all warm to our middle class.
</br>
</br>
I like logarithms and prefer them over linear scales <a
	href="http://dilawarrajput.wordpress.com/2011/02/lobbying-for-logarithms.html">Lobbying
	for logarithm</a> and I've found languages interesting <a
	href="http://dilawarrajput.wordpress.com/2010/09/whats-there-in-language.html">What's
	there in Language</a>. I have collected some notes on <a

	case of happiness.</a>.
</br>
</br>
Ok, I hate Times of India, so here is some rant about it <a
	href="http://dilawarrajput.wordpress.com/2010/10/times-of-idiots.html">Times of
	Idiots</a>. And something is <a
	href="http://dilawarrajput.wordpress.com/2012/03/in-praise-of-sachin-tendulkar.html">
	In praise of Sachin Tendulkar</a>.

also my views on Jairam Ramesh comments about IITs <a
	href="http://dilawarrajput.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/narcissism-of-the-neurotics.html">Narcissism
	of the neurotics</a>.
</br>
</br>
Since I plan to remain in academics, I wanted to justify my choice <a
    href="http://wp.me/p2Ob7E-1b">Seeking a career in declining profession</a>. 
And here is my reflection on <a
	href="http://wp.me/p2Ob7E-1v">being a teaching assistant </a>and my  <a
	href="http://wp.me/p2Ob7E-27">viva policies.</a>. And most importantly, <a
  href="http://wp.me/p2Ob7E-2U">self-reliance of Indian intellectuals</a>
</br>
<br>
And of-course, I have been <a
    href="http://wp.me/p2Ob7E-2W">thinking of women</a>.
<br>
<br>
Etc. etc..
