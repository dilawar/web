title: About me
---

I am a graduate student at [department of electrical engineering](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in) at IIT Bombay. I work in [HPC lab](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~hpc). 

My area of research is partitioning of large scale systems. I also dribble in
graph theory, linear algebra and functional programming languages. I have more
than a layman interest in social anthropology.

I am perhaps the yougest Nehruvian alive. I have tremendous respect for Prof.
Andre Beteille. I am greatly benefitted from his books.

I am active on a google-group
[Samwad](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/samwadiitb). I post
some of my thoughts on social situations there.
