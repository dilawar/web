<h3>About</h3>

<BODY LANG="en-IN" DIR="LTR">
	<P>Hello fellow Humans!	I like to be called <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilawar"
	TARGET="_blank">Dilawar</A> ( <FONT FACE="DejaVu Sans"><SPAN LANG="zxx">दिलावर
	</SPAN></FONT>) which now I find quite a nice name and bit romantic also if
	spoken by a pretty and smiling girl. In my childhood, I did not like my name. It was way too <i>
	heavy </i> to carry around. Though my life speaks for itself but most of the
time it has poor grammar. Anyway here are most of my accomplishments and deeds
I've done.
<br>
<br>

The only video game I have ever completed is <i>IGI-2</i>. I have never played
<i>Mario-2 </i>but loved <i>Need for Speed
- Hot Pursuit</i>. I have never ever been accused of <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>. I
	have lived in 3 states of India and never been abroad. I contend that I am not
	running away from anyone. My current mobile number has 2 prime factors and
	once I wrote a letter to a girl and have waited for an answer for at least 6
	months, hence I proved that <i>love letter</i> does not always work.  I never
	rode an elephant, donkey or a horse, although in my childhood I did ride
	buffaloes, cows and street dogs. I do not know how to swim but dream of
	swimming across <i>Indian Ocean</i>. I was bitten by a bitch once on my butt
	when I was looking at her puppies and by Gangaram's horse on my back for no
	obvious reason reason. I hate Gangaram.  <br><br> Now I do have a profile on a
	social network site and I never got sunburns. I can do farming and love
	walking in campus on the <i> Thinking Road</i> which connects my hostel and my
	department.  <br><br>

Since my childhood, I have consumed more than 8659 liters of cow's milk. I have
never played any musical instruments and have stopped singing after hearing my
own recordings. I just love Indian Ocean, especially Sushmit Guitar. I have
trouble with English grammar and in my pursuit of English, I lost my grip over
<i>Hindi</i>. I'd love to be emotionally bilingual.

<br><br>
If by any chance you are a Historian or Anthropologist, here is my brief history. 
<br>
<br>
My ancestor were so happy living in Iran. <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avestan_language">Avestan</a> was their
mother tongue. It was written right to left and have a strong emphasis on minute
phonological differences.
<br>
<br>
One day I don't know what happened, a group of dissidents broke away. They were
literally pissed off. Why? Hard to say! May be because they were dissidents and
did not like others hushing them up. Or may be, they were just pissed off. They
decided that they must leave and start their own. It could well had been a case
of 'get lost you ass******". But whatever was the case, they did not like the
<i>status-quo.</i>
<br>
<br>
So they took their horses and came to settle in North India. Few of them
migrated to Europe and now known as <i>German</i>. They called
themselves '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arya">aryan</a>' which was
derived from <i>Avestan</i>. They might have killed and displaced a large number of '<a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidians">Dravidian</a>' over there who
were the native of this land.<i> Dravidians</i> now live in South India and are proud
of their longest surviving 'culture' despite of this colossal plundering (if
happened).
My&nbsp;ancestors&nbsp;must have been a ruthless tribe when it came to its own
benefits. A characteristics which we still posses. Aryans, as they called
themselves were fond of horses. In fact, old Indus-Valley civilisation never
knew of horses. <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/fline/fl1720/17200040.htm">All
	of they knew were bulls and cows</a>.
<br>
<br>
So pissed of my ancesstors was with their Aventan brothers that they came up
their own language and gave it name 'Sanskrit' (the perfect one). They must have
liked to make things perfect. I like that. They did not like to write the way
their Avestan brothers did. They wrote &nbsp;left to right. In addition, I don't
know why, they did not like the sound of 'h'. They replace 'h' with 's'. So
<i>Hapta-Hindu</i> became <i>Sapta-Sindhu</i>, <i>Ahura</i> is now <i>Asura,
	Harxvati</i>&nbsp;is <i>Sarasvati</i>&nbsp;and so on.&nbsp;But this did not
stop here, often the meaning of gods were also reserved, . Not
surprisingly,&nbsp;<i>Ahura</i>&nbsp;were gods in <i>Avestan</i>,
<i>Asura</i>&nbsp;is the demon in Sanskrit. <i>Indira</i> is king of god for the
Sanskrit, He was demon for the Avestan. Seriously something really bad must have
haveened among them.. <a href="http://www.ancientscripts.com/avestan.html">In
	fact, the oldest Avestan is so similar to the oldest Sanskrit that you can
	translate text in one language to another by anotherlying few phonological
	changes</a>. Like so:
<br>
<br>
Blue is Avestan, Black is Sanskrit. The ə symbol represents the mid central
vowel (schwa) like the "e"s in "taken". First line is Aventan, second is in
Sanskrit.
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Initially, 'arya' meant 'to till'. This was considered a noble profession. This,
still, is considered noble. I myself is a son of farmer. <a
	href="http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XsOtRGdvIigC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">Then
	&nbsp;they decided that there should be the the division of labour and came
	out with caste-system</a>. Arya in this age came to mean 'the noble', why?
Elites were not in 'agriculture' so they came up with this meaning to reclaim
this title. So few of my ancestor became Noble, and the person who did farming
is considered <i>Mlichcha </i>(the lower one, not-pure). The Sanskrit was
refined in this period and the best grammar in the world was written by <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini">Panini</a>. A new
language was evolved which is called <i><a
		href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakrit">Prakriat</a>t</i>.
<i>Prakrit</i>&nbsp;was spoken by the masses and <i>Sanskrit</i> was reserved as
the language of learning, a prerogatives of elites - the brahmos (Brahmins).
Pratrik was considered a language of <i>Malichcha (</i>the lower ones). In fact,
even in these days, Sanskrit is replaced by English in letter and spirit. The
language which evolved from <i>Prakrit</i>&nbsp;(e.g. Hindi and its relatives)
is now spokes by masses and considered the language of <i>Malichcha </i>by
English-speaking elites (never mind the lip-services - which largely comes from
the slight&nbsp;embarrassment for not being able to honour their mother-tongue.
Its better to call it native-tongue so the&nbsp;embarrassment&nbsp;will be less.
The word 'mother' has &nbsp;morality related to it also.).&nbsp;In few years,
their literature could be found in&nbsp;museum with the tag, "Look, your
ancestor used to read this.".
<br>
<br>
My ancestor was very curious about universe. Their whole knowledge was centered
around the universe. Astrology and Mathematics were intertwined. Whatever they
knew, they put it in 'Vedas' which literally meant 'to know'. This was their
science. I am so proud of them. When 'Vedas' came to end, they called it
Vedanta, 'The end of knowing'. Why would they do that? I can not say! Perhaps
they stopped appreciating the changes. Perhaps that was the worst thing to happen
in our life.
<br>
<br>
Since then my ancestor lost sight which way they are going. Hinduism was never
been a religion, it was considered a way of life. Now its been downgraded to a
religion and people fight over it everyday almost all the time - in fact there
was a time in which the most narrowed version of Hinduism (Hindutva) came to
fore. Perhaps the strongest quality of Hinduism lies in its chaotic nature for
allowing every kind of infusion into it, that is why it survived (to quote <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashis_Nandy">Ashish Nandy</a>).
<br>
<br>
Being in a rich and fertile land is not easy. Lot of people vie for it. Han
Chinese attacked these lands. Few stayed, married here and settled down in the
areas now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Scythian">called Haryana,
	Punjab and near by</a>&nbsp;places. Few of them are known as <i><a
		href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jat_people">Jats</a></i>. Alexander came
to India and few of his soldiers stayed here. They married the local princess.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_Rajputs">They now belong to a
	much wider idea of 'Rajputs</a>'. A clan of them in known as <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauhan">Chauhans</a>. They have a rich
tradition and not to mention larger than life Chauhan king, the <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prithvi_Raj_Chauhan">Prithviraj Chauhan</a>
who is fondly remember for his valour among the old and among the teens for his
love affair with princess <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanyogita">Sanyogitika</a>. My forefathers
belongs to this clan. Chauhans are generally considered soft in nature, quite a
painful insinuation in the land which is surrounded by more feudal clans
of<i>Jats, Vishnoi, Thakurs, Chaudhiry</i> etc. Perhaps this is because
due to the fact that domestic violence is the lowest among them. So the
childhood is passed without witnessing much violence and that mellowed them
down.They also have a long tradition of treating women with utmost pride and
dignity. I am so proud to share that heritage.The relative sanity of my village
is due to the lack of interest in alcohol and other manly stuff.<br>
<br>
So I stand here in front of you. My first name is like Muslim as to prove my
Iranian links. There is symbol of 'OM' permanently&nbsp;tattooed&nbsp;on my
right hand as to symbolize my 'Vedic roots'. My clan shares their genes with
Greeks who are quite famous for their Mathematics and Philosophy, and a fierce
individualism. And of course not to mention the educational exposure which I
have been through which is by large is Western. I inhibit in myself a long and
rich history. This makes me warm again and again.
