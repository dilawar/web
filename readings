Most of the time I like to read and rarely I study too. Here are some of them which has shaped me throughout my life.

    * First and foremost, newspaper The Hindu. People calls it 'left leaning' but if there is nothing 'right' in this 'left biased newspaper' then nothing left in 'right wing opinion'. 
Personally, I do not see anything like that.
    * Seminar Magazine
    * Guardian Newspaper. Especially It's CIF section (comment is free but facts are sacred.) You may like it's Science, Technology, and Culture sections.
    * Economic and Political Weekly - A Marxist magazine - A must read for anyone interested in either economics or politics.
    * www.indiatogether.org
    * The little Magazine. This is great for those who like literature (Lovers of pulp fiction, stay away...)
    * Frontline.
