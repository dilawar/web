<p>
  Please visit after taking a long nap. I do not have anything unusually cool to 
tell.
  Nonetheless you may like to read my blogs <a

</p>	<h3> Interests </h3>

<p> As far as my graduate studies are concerned, I have been working on and 
learning algorithm design for FPGAs. I was trained as a VLSI designer, and my 
work is mostly in the field of VLSI CAD.  <b>Mathematics</b> and <b>Social 
Anthropology</b> are my hobbies and I spend a fair amount of time learning these 
subjects.  <br><br> I easily	get curious about people, especially when they act 
as a group. My interests in anthropology are limited to middle classes and their 
institutes simply because I live among them. I also have 	a very soft corner for 
Indian History. Irfan Habib, Ranajit Guha, D. D. Kosambi  and Ramachandra Guha 
are my favorite historian. I love reading and writing essays.  Andre Beteille 
and Ramachandra Guha are my favorite writers. P. Sainath and T.  Ramachandran 
are my favorite journalists. And I hate <i>Times of India</i>.
</p>	

<p> I do not like fiction much unless written by grass-root writers. I have 
tremendous respect for Premchand, Leo Tolstoy, Sadat Hasan Manto, Sharatchandra 
and Tagore. I love listening to alternative music. <b>Indian Ocean</b> is my 
favorite band; I love Coke-studio Pakistan.  </p>
  
<h3>Career</h3>
<p> I need an excuse to spend time on university. My dream job could be of a 
librarian, a reader or a professor.  </p>
