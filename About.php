<h3>About</h3>

<BODY LANG="en-IN" DIR="LTR">
<p>Hello fellow Humans!	I like to be called <A 
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilawar"
TARGET="_blank">Dilawar</A> ( <FONT FACE="DejaVu Sans"><SPAN LANG="zxx">दिलावर
</SPAN></FONT>) which I now find quite nice and bit romantic too if
  spoken by a pretty girl. In my childhood, I did not like my name. 
It was way too <i>  heavy </i> to carry around.</p>

<p> Though my life speaks for itself but most of the time it has poor grammar. 
Following are most of my accomplishments and deeds I've done. </p>

<p>The only video game I have ever completed is <tt>IGI-2</tt>. I have never 
played <tt>Mario-2 </tt>but loved <tt>Need for Speed - Hot Pursuit</tt>. I have 
never ever been accused of <tt>Grand Theft Auto</tt>. I have lived in 3 states 
of India and never been abroad. I contend that I am not running away from 
anyone.  My current mobile number has 7 prime factors and I once wrote a 
love-letter to a girl and waited for an answer for at least 6 months, therefore, 
I proved that <tt>love-letters</tt> do not always work.  I never rode an 
elephant, donkey or a horse, although in my childhood I did ride buffaloes, cows 
and street dogs. I do not know how to swim but dream of swimming across 
<i>Indian Ocean</i>. I was bitten by a bitch once on my butt when I was looking 
at her puppies and by Gangaram's horse on my back for no obvious reason reason. 
I really hate Gangaram. </p>  

<p>I do not have a profile on any social network site and 
I never got sunburns. I can do farming and love walking in campus on <i>Then 
Thinking Road</i> which connects my hostel and my department.  </p>

<p> Since my childhood, I have consumed more than 8659 liters of cow's milk. I have
never played any musical instruments and have stopped singing after hearing my
own recordings. I just love Indian Ocean, especially Sushmit Guitar. I have
trouble with English grammar and in my pursuit of English, I lost my grip over
<i>Hindi</i>. I'd love to be emotionally bilingual.</p>

<p>If by any chance you are a Historian or Anthropologist, here is my brief history. 
</p>

<p class='history'>
My ancestor were so happy living in Iran. <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avestan_language">Avestan</a> was their
mother tongue. It was written right to left and have a strong emphasis on minute
phonological differences. </p>

<p class='history'>
One day I don't know what happened, a group of dissidents broke away. They were
literally pissed off. Why? Hard to say! May be because they were dissidents and
did not like others hushing them up. Or may be, they were just pissed off. They
decided that they must leave and start their own. It could well had been a case
of 'get lost you ass*****". But whatever was the case, they did not like the
<i>status-quo.</i>. </p>

<p class='history'> So they took their horses and came to settle in North India. 
Few of them migrated to Europe and now known as <i>German</i>. They called 
themselves '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arya">aryan</a>' which was 
derived from <i>Avestan</i>. They might have displaced a large number of '<a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidians">Dravidian</a>' over there who are 
claimed to be the native of this land.<i> Dravidians</i> now live in South India 
and are proud of their longest surviving 'culture' despite of this colossal 
plundering (if happened). </p>

<p class='history'>
My&nbsp;ancestors&nbsp;must have been a ruthless tribe when it came to its own 
benefits. <tt>Aryans</tt>, as they called themselves, were fond of horses. In 
fact, old Indus-Valley civilisation never knew of horses. <a 
href="http://www.thehindu.com/fline/fl1720/17200040.htm">All they knew were 
bulls and cows</a>.  </p>

<p class='history'>
So pissed of my ancesstors was with their Aventan brothers that they came up
their own language and gave it name <tt>Sanskrit</tt> (the perfect one). They must have
liked to make things perfect. I like that. They did not like to write the way
their Avestan brothers did. They wrote &nbsp;left to right. In addition, I don't
know why, they did not like the sound of 'h'. They replace 'h' with 's'. So
<i>Hapta-Hindu</i> became <i>Sapta-Sindhu</i>, <i>Ahura</i> is now <i>Asura,
	Harxvati</i>&nbsp;is <i>Sarasvati</i>&nbsp;and so on.&nbsp;But this did not
stop here, often the meaning of gods were also reserved, . Not
surprisingly,&nbsp;<i>Ahura</i>&nbsp;were gods in <i>Avestan</i>,
<i>Asura</i>&nbsp;is the demon in Sanskrit. <i>Indira</i> is king of god for the
Sanskrit, He was demon for the Avestan. Seriously something really bad must have
haveened among them. In fact old Avestan is <a href="http://www.ancientscripts.com/avestan.html"> 
similar to the oldest Sanskrit</a>. You can translate text in one language to another by anotherlying few phonological changes</a>. Like so:

<p class='history'>
Blue is Avestan, Black is Sanskrit. The ə symbol represents the mid central
vowel (schwa) like the "e"s in "taken". First line is Aventan, second is in
Sanskrit. </p>

<p class='history'>

Initially, 'arya' meant 'to till'. In those agrarian societies, it was 
considered a noble profession. This, still, is considered noble by some if not 
by many. <a 
href="http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XsOtRGdvIigC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">Then 
&nbsp;they decided that there should be the the division of labour and came out 
with caste-system</a>. Arya in this age came to mean 'the noble'. Why?  Elites 
were not in 'agriculture' so they changed the meaning to reclaim this title. So 
few of my ancestor became noble, and those who did farming were considered 
<tt>mlichcha</tt> (the lower one, not-pure). The Sanskrit was refined in this 
period and the best grammar in the world was written by <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini">Panini</a>. Indian 
intellectual traditon in those days was too exclusive in nature. Learning of 
Sanskrit was the prerogative of few. Needless to say, a new language was evolved 
which is called <i><a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakrit">Prakrit</a></i>.
<i>Prakrit</i>&nbsp;was spoken by the masses and <i>Sanskrit</i> was reserved as
the language of learning and scholarship.  Pratrik was considered a language of 
<i>Malichcha (</i>the lower ones). In fact,
even these days, Sanskrit is replaced by English in letter and spirit. The
language which evolved from <i>Prakrit</i>&nbsp;(e.g. Hindi and its relatives)
is now spokes by masses and considered the language of <tt>malichcha</tt> by
English-speaking elites (never mind the lip-services to their mother tounge 
which largely comes from
the slight&nbsp;embarrassment for not being able to honour their mother-tongue.)
</p>

<p class='history'>
My ancestors were curious about universe. Their knowledge was centered
around the universe. Astrology and Mathematics were intertwined. Whatever they
knew, they put it in <tt>Vedas</tt> which literally meant 'to know'. This was their
science. I feel proud of them. When 'Vedas' came to end, they called it
Vedanta : 'the end of knowing'. Why would they do that? I can not say! Perhaps
they stopped appreciating the changes. Perhaps that was the worst thing to 
happen in our intellectual life. </p>

<p class='history'>
Since then my ancestor lost sight of the way they were going. Hinduism was never
a religion; it was considered a way of life. Now it has been downgraded to a
religion and people fight over it everyday almost all the time - in fact there
was a time in which the most narrowed version of Hinduism (so called Hindutva) came to
fore. Perhaps the strongest quality of Hinduism lies in its chaotic nature for
allowing every kind of infusion into it, that is why it survived (to quote <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashis_Nandy">Ashish Nandy</a>).
</p>

<p class='history'>
Living in a rich and fertile land is not without any danger. Lot of people vie for such lands. Han
Chinese attacked these lands. Few stayed, married here, and settled down in the
places <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Scythian">called Haryana,
  Punjab and near by</a>&nbsp; areas. Few of them are known as <i><a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jat_people">Jats</a></i>. Alexander came
to India and few of his soldiers stayed here. They married local princess.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_Rajputs">They now belong to a
  much wider idea of 'Rajputs</a>'. A clan of them in known as <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauhan">Chauhans</a>. They have a rich
tradition and not to mention larger than life Chauhan king, the <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prithvi_Raj_Chauhan">Prithviraj Chauhan</a>
who is fondly remember for his valour among old and for his
love affair with princess <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanyogita">Sanyogitika</a> among the teens. My forefathers
belongs to this clan. Chauhans are generally considered soft in nature, quite a
painful insinuation in the land which is surrounded by more feudal clans
of<i>Jats, Vishnoi, Thakurs, Chaudhiry</i> etc. This is perhaps 
due to the fact that domestic violence is the lowest among them. So the
childhood is passed without witnessing much violence and that mellowed them
down. They had a long tradition of treating women with utmost pride and
dignity. I am proud to own that heritage. The relative sanity of my village
is due to the lack of interest in alcohol and other manly stuff.</p>

<p class='history'>
So I stand here in front of you. My first name is like a Muslim as to prove my
Iranian links. There is symbol of 'OM' permanently&nbsp;tattooed&nbsp;on my
right hand as to symbolize my 'Vedic roots'. My clan shares their genes with
Greeks who are quite famous for their Mathematics, Philosophy and system of 
governance. And of course not to mention the educational exposure which I
have been through is mostly Western. I am a product of such a long and
rich history. This feeling makes me warm again and again.
