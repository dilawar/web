Prof. Harihar Narayanan (HN) retired last month from Electrical Engineering Department. He has been be at the center of student mentor-ship program for undergraduates at institute level. I believe that he had some success with academically poor undergraduates. And since department has tried hard to retain him for few more years as adjunct-professor, he plans to devote one day each week to mentor department's research scholars. Each Saturday we will meet to discuss this-and-that. This is a great opportunity for me as a sociologist to do some field work as participant-observer. And to get some taste of social life also.<!-- more -->

In the last meeting, there were around 44 PhD students, mainly from EE and some from CSE department. Few of them were new students but mainly they were senior Ph. D. students.

He likes to talk and feels rejuvenated after giving a good lecture. It was not easy for him but he tried hard not to make this discussion monologue. He encouraged students to point out problems and to offer suggestions and comments for the department. Many of them are listed below. Not in the same form they were uttered by the students, he generalized many of them. It was a moderated session and a senior faculty was present. Therefore many of these comments and complains are very mild compared to what they usually complain to their peers. The Indian habit of 'comparing everything with the worst' is not visible. There is a good chance that something useful will come out of this.

**Complaints**



	
  * Research (in India?) driven by publication rather than originality.

	
  * Not always `relevant'.

	
  * PhD students dont work hard. (No one complained about it, this one he put on board by himself).

	
  * Little or no office space.

	
  * TA duties not always spelled out clearly and workload is not shared properly.

	
  * How to make learning/exploration enjoyable.

	
  * Sometimes a student is interested in a topic other than the allotted one. (On this he talks for a while. He suggested to steer the problem according to your interest)


**Suggestions**



	
  * Should be a balance between theoretical and practical work.

	
  * Originality should be encouraged.

	
  * Maths dept should be bigger!

	
  * There should be more intra/inter department interaction.

	
  * Social interaction with faculty/guide.

	
  * Crash courses by PhD students within and outside dept.

	
  * More interaction with external world (It was suggested that they should also teach in engineering colleges. It will help them to learn and also to earn some money.).

	
  * How to make all students flourish simultaneously? (He generalized some other suggestion)


**Comments**



	
  * Mentoring should be its own reward (He strongly emphasized on it).


It was surprising no-one complain about the amount of money they are getting during their Ph.D.. This is a major concerns shown by students who leave India for higher studies (I myself has heard students saying it many times). I am not sure money is the only thing they will miss if they remain they India. But they like to point it out forcefully.

At the end, he asked student to write small autobiography to be submitted in the next meeting. This autobiography will be confidential. He stressed that autobiography should contain likes and dislikes and strengths and weaknesses as perceived by students.

He also asked students to come prepared with their topics (where applicable) and present to smaller groups first (5- 10 minute presentations) say 10 in each group (60-70 mins). They must cut out jargon so that talk should be understandable to an educated layman.
