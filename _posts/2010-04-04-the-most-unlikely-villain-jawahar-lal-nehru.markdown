**It would not matter what kind of mess they made – and they would make a mess, if they governed themselves, the people of India. They would probably make the greatest muddle possible.**




                                 -- D. H. Lawrence, [_Aaron's Rod_](http://www.literature.org/authors/lawrence-david-herbert/aarons-rod/chapter-02.html)







**My legacy to India? Hopefully, it is 400 million people capable of governing themselves.**




-- Jawaharlal Nehru







Different people hate him for different reasons : not only these reasons are an outcome of hindsight but they are also mutually contradictory. In his work of appreciation and depreciation rather than dispassionate scholarship, a noted historian Ramachandra Guha says that '_for the BJP Nehru could not represent the ‘spirit of India’ because he did not subscribe to the right religion – indeed he subscribed to no religion at all'_. And for the Lohiaite, his being unfit to rule was _'proven by the fact that he stood apart, in class, culture, and language, from those he ruled over'_. The Gandhian critique takes a different line of argument altogether. It contends that Nehru, writes Guha, _'despite being the Mahatma’s acknowledged heir ultimately betrayed his legacy. Where Gandhi fought for a country based on agriculture, a confederation of self sufficient village republics'_. They see Nehru, _'as having imposed a model of industrial development that centralised power in the cities by devastating the countryside'_. Those who attack Nehru in the Mahatma’s name have argued forcefully that 'planned industrialization has fuelled both environmental degradation and social conflict, outcomes that could have been avoided if India had instead followed a ‘Gandhian’ approach to economic development .”

We also have Jana Sangh, now metamorphosed into Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), attacking Nehru’s philosophy of secularism, which they claim is rested on the appeasement of the minorities and is responsible for all ethical conflicts in India, most notably, in Kashmir; so called Lohitias, no longer in power, attacks him for being upper-caste, upper-class and English speaking intelligentsia which they seek to replace.






To these Hindutvavadi, Lohiaite, and Gandhian critiques has now been added a fourth. They comes from my generation, supporters of economic liberalization who point an accusatory finger at Nehru for not pushing the state up to the commanding heights of the economy. Without Nehru’s folly, they say, India, would long since have become a Tiger to beat all the other Asian Tigers. As a passionate free-marketeer remarked recently, Raj Krishan derisive phrase, the ‘Hindu rate of growth should be renamed the ‘Nehru rate of growth.” These days we often see newspapers and magazines scoffing at 'Nehru socialist policies'. Curiously, a noted Historian D. D. Koshami have criticised Nehru for bringing capitalism to India in guise of socialism.






If such a bashing would be welcome by the BJP then, tacitly, Congress would not shy away from ignoring him. For his own party has turned his back on him and do not make any use of his name or legacy. There is hardly any political capital left in his name.






He is no contemporary of mine and with the benefit of hindsight, I can find faults with anyone from the bygone era. He has been a personality to cherish, even before I was educated by him through his books, _the discovery of India_ and His another book which I am reading now, '_Glimpse of world history'_ . Remarkably both of the books were written when he was in prison. When _Glimpse…_ was published, New York Times reviewed this book by noting that "_It is one of the most remarkable books ever written... Nehru makes even H.G. Wells seem singularly insular... One is awed by the breadth of Nehru's culture." _







Being a farmer by birth, my relationships with him are rather passionate. Most of us are not aware of what he did for us. Indians are generally very amnesic. Perhaps he was the last one in Indian politics who really cared about farmers [- the one who could bring ninth schedule to make land reforms](http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2402/stories/20070209005101200.htm), for him – "anything else can wait but agriculture."  [After doing my post graduation in one of the IIT's makes this relationship more passionate and reading his book make it rather personal.](http://www.blogger.com/goog_1983848411)







Guha, sums up his life in the following phrase : '**our once but not the future king**'. This blog has taken a lot of input from this remarkable essays as well as from his masterpiece, ‘_India after Gandhi_' and 'The makers of modern India'. But in a post, putting reference in every line does not look very pleasant.

63 years have passed since our independence. In a country's life, it's a very long time. Sarvapalli Gopal wrote three volumes of biography of Nehru's published in 1984. The last line of third and last volume of his biography runs, '_He was India's once - and we may hope – the future king.' _By the time Gopal finished his studies, the image of Nehru was at its nadir. If we have to measure the depth for this nosedive, one may consider the works of Rajni Kothari.[ Who knows the works of Kothari will not call him an admirer of Nehru](http://www.india-seminar.com/1999/481/481%20kothari.htm). The essay was published in Economic weekly in 1964.With Nehru's memory fresh in his mind, he wrote of the late PM's_ 'great unifying role' in a difficult period of transition, his shaping of institutions and procedure of democracies in a large, diverse, and newly independent country. Nehru, _wrote Kothari_, 'give rise to pragmatic orientation to politics, taught leaders the art of managing men and institutions and based political solidarity on the complex mechanics of secular relationships rather than on neat notation of scarifies and transcendental nationalism.' Moreover, he created an ideological consensus on the need to wed socialism with democracy, _a consensus, Kothari clearly believed would last and render obsolete_ 'the wholly artificial left-right dichotomy in our politics'. _Dismissing talk of 'end of an era' with Nehru demise, the political scientist commented,_ 'Nothing has ended with passing away of Nehru : everything of the values he left are going to last. _‘There could be '_no better memorial' _to the recently deceased leader, he concluded, '_than a continuous search for building further on the foundation he left behind and wherever necessary, improving upon them.'_






Nehru must have dominated the moral, intellectual and political landscape of India. But after 67 years, Kothari assessment can now be seen wide off the mark. Guha says, 'The ideological consensus Nehru nurtured has broken down as tendencies of left and right, far from being render obsolete, have emphatically reasserted themselves. No longer are political alliances built on the 'complex mechanism of secular relationships.' Rather, caste, religion, and ethnicity, 'primordial' ties as it were, are increasingly what bind political parties and movement. Again the values and procedures of democracies, which Nehru deeply cherished and upheld, have cast by the way wind. No one has worked on 'building upon or improving' the foundation he laid, though a good many have tried to destroy them. [ibid, pp 178]







Curiously enough, his supporters are only to be found in Marxist circles. So long as he lived, Marxist were unsparing in their criticism of Nehru,  'He is not made of the same fiber as for Lenin or Stalin'. This is changed because since He stands for public sector undertakings, and with Eastern Europe gone, these PSUs stands as flagship of socialism, to be defended to last. (ibid, pp 180)

In western world, a lot of people who were outcast of one Age became hero for another. Nehru case is one more case in the long list of social phenomenon which runs upside down in India. This transformation is made all the more poignant, when we consider how serenely he was confident of his place in the heart of India’s posterity. This comes out in this Last Will and Testament, where he asserts that the Indian People have loved him as they loved no one else before or since. So why such a decline?






During Mood-Indigo 2010, Ramachandra Guha told us what his teacher Andre Beteille remarked once in classroom, "_There is an aphorism in Bible that your sin will visit your seventh generation. Nehru case proves this maxim in reverse. ...Sins of his seven generations have come to visit him._" Indeed, he stands apart from all of his children, in both ability and character. He could have become a successful lawyer or an international best-seller writer but he chose to serve his nation - it was a vocation for him. His one of the least quoted lines, "_We are small people serving great cause, since the cause is so great some of the greatness will fall on us too." shows how seriously he took his job._ His children, after failing miserably in distinguishing themselves in other professions, took their mother advice and turn to Congress where a place was reserved for them at the top.


According to Ram Guha, he made one mistake in his life, namely '_all political captains should retire on time.' _Gaddaffi did not retire and thus turned from hero to an outcast. Manmohan Singh could have survived history as one of the most forthright PM of India. He also did not retire on time. Sachin Tendular faced the most severe criticism from those who are now calling him god when he was a captain. I am not sure if barring Sunil Gavaskar, any caption in India have retired on time.








Guha was told a tale by an old I.C.S. officer C. S. Venkatachar. One day in the mid nineteen fifties, shortly before he achieved superannuation, Venkatachar passed the prime minister in the corridors of the sectariat. ‘I say Venkatchar’, said Nehru. ‘I believe you are retiring soon. Have I given you a photograph of myself?’ The reply was in negative, so Nehru sent him a framed and inscribed photograph at once.




[![](http://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-media/49/9849-004-75880243.jpg)](http://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-media/49/9849-004-75880243.jpg)That photo, the famous Karl Karsch portrait of the philosopher-king in contemplative mood, thereafter dominated Venkatachar’s drawing room. The civilian died in 1999; but in the deference to his memory the family has not disturbed the arrangement of artifacts in his room. In the extension of Jayamahal extension, thus, there stand a small memorial of Nehru. Thousands of other Indian homes, meanwhile, discarded their own lovingly framed photographs of our once but not the future kings. [ibid, pp 181].







Perhaps it is the high time we look at the legacy he wished to left behind. Are we, 1.2 billion Indians, capable to govern ourselves? He was confident that India will survive. During his lifetime, her obituary are being written. Most of the critics are hopeful.

Till India survives as  a democracy, Nehru legacy will live on even if among the handful of hearts. Perhaps He is the only villain in the world, who never had a visible Hero against him. Just like our environment minister in the past, [Jairam Ramesh who can not be made a villain unless you cast Bt-Branjil and highways as heroes.](http://www.blogger.com/goog_1983848425)





A scholar-ruler who ruled over much narrow minded generation of Indians should not be at pain at his fallen stocks. It is very easy to paint him as a villain and there are so many too ready to believe it. Such belief is not based on facts but what what one retired cricketer observed about his countrymen,  'few days ago they were singing IPL, IPL.. then they sang LOKPAL, LOKPAL, now they are singing F1, F1.. Government should pass an 'anti herd instinct bill''.







Some Westners still think you are great. They are making a movie on his life. Indian Government is worried about any kissing scene between you and Lady Mountbatten. In India, as we all know, a great man is not supposed to have an erection while any dim-wit, who does not know his ass from his elbow, can become great here by virtue of living a life of a god-men.  A lot have changed in India but the [grip of irrationality](http://beta.epw.in/newsItem/comment/189843/) is still strong.
