There is a very jubilant mood among 'ghar ki murgis' in Nichalpur. Because their beloved equation of their well-being '_ghar ki murgi daal barabar' _is showing wonderful numbers after the skyrocketing price rise in _daal._ You might be aware that this equation fetched a _'kukduku prize' _for _Ramlaal Murga _who was an economist. This prize is given by 'Gangaram Academy of Science' and 'Ramlaal' was the only Murga ever to win it.  
  
However, there were some voices of concerns who were asking why some of 'ghar ki murgis' vanished and their remains found on the backyard, just like of Ramlaal. Some people are saying that that is an act of committing suicide since some Murgis can not stand the mental pressure or rising economy. Some are saying that they have committed suicide because they were consuming liquors. Some even believes that is work of "Chicxals' who believes that some humans eats because they can no longer afford 'daal'. They are fightening for 'Ghar ki Murgi' emancipation from a threat unknown. They might have killed them.  
  
There were celebration all the night. There was some MOU signed between them and a FAT CAT who visit this village sometimes. The details of the MOU has not been made 'public'.
