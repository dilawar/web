<p>I am a graduate student in <a href="www.ee.iitb.ac.in">Department of 
Electrical Engineering</a>. I took my undergraduate degree in 
<tt>Instrumentation and control engineering</tt> from <tt>Some college</tt> in 
Chennai. I did my <tt>Master in Technology</tt> in <tt>Microelectronics and 
VLSI</tt> from this institute during 2007-09. <a 
href="http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/dinesh">DuKS</a> (therefore, I am a 
<b>duckling</b>) was my thesis advisor on <tt>Fabrication of microelectode 
arrays for retinal prosthesis</tt>.  I joined back the department in August 2011 
for pursuing a doctorate.</p>

<p>These days, I work in <a href="www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~hpc">High Performance 
Computation lab</a></b>, less commonly known as <b>L.W.C.A </b>(Lab Without a 
Cool Acronym).  </p>

<p> If you are looking for a internship in this lab then you are most welcome to 
send you resume to either to me or to <a 
href="http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~hpc/people.html">other lab members</a>. You 
should also browse <a href="http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/patkar"> Prof. 
Patkar's web page </a> </p>
