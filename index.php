<H2>Dilawar Singh</H2>

<p>I am a graduate student in <a href="www.ee.iitb.ac.in">Department of 
Electrical Engineering</a>. I took my undergraduate degree in 
<tt>Instrumentation and control engineering</tt> from <tt>Some college</tt> in 
Chennai. I did my <tt>Master in Technology</tt> in <tt>Microelectronics and 
VLSI</tt> from this institute during 2007-09. <a 
href="http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/dinesh">DuKS</a> was my thesis 
advisor (therefore a duckling) on <tt>Fabrication of microelectode arrays for 
retinal prosthesis</tt>.  I joined back the department in August 2011 for 
pursuing a doctorate.</p>

<p>These days, I work in newly established <a 
href="http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~hpc">High Performance Computation lab</a></b>, 
less commonly known as <b>L.W.C.A </b>(Lab Without a Cool Acronym).  </p>

<h3> Internship and project </h3>

<p> If you are looking for an internship or some project in this lab then you 
are most welcome to contact <a href="mailto:dilawar@ee.iitb.ac.in">me</a> or to <a 
href="http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~hpc/people.html">other lab members</a> for details. You 
should also browse <a href="http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/patkar"> Prof.  
Patkar's web page </a>to know more about lab activities.</p>
    
<p>This is how I look under normal circumtances. </p>
