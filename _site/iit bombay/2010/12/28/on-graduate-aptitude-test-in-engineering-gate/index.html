        <div class="entry"><p>Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering is designed to test your  basics in engineering. It has nothing to do with experiences in industries. By engineering basics, I mean your core courses. You must know them. I  was bit troubled with all these mushrooming of GATE coaching centres on the line of JEE and  the way they 'buy' opinion to suit their business, so I am  writing this.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure that one can succeed in exams without using these centre. There is hardly any  need of them unless you really can't do anything without spoon feeding. But they create an atmosphere where one can build a momentum to study - if one is occupied with 'inertia'. Nonetheless, attending coaching classes is always better than doing nothing. Anyway  spend your time wisely. If you really have time to spare, read quality books.</p>

<p>It does not matter if problems asked in GATE are hard or easy. Competition is tough, and it is getting tougher with the rise in numbers of applications every year.  Success in such competitions increases one's confidence. But one should not take it as a benchmark of one's capabilities - after  all its an exam and that too of A, B, C, D type. If one bad day in you exam should not  make you loose your confidence then one ultra-good day must not make you  take undue pride in your capabilities. Though the chances of possessed  by later is much higher than the former. In case of failure, there are  many factors one can blame. But success is always believed to be due to 'me and myself only'.</p>

<p>However, I  must admit that 'success' is very necessary evil in one form or other.  It boosts one confidence - should one is unfortunate to have little or  moderate amount of it. But this 'confidence' evaporates easily if stop putting lesser effort in her later ventures. Even on these lines, GATE is  not the only thing to strive for. From improving your father's business  to solving century old problems, there are many options available.  Undue 'pride' and 'vanity' generally ruins people in long run, so does  a low self-esteem. If you are convinced that you can not excel in GATE then there is no point writing this exam. If you let failure hitting you, you will start thinking negatively about yourself. There is no point reducing your self confident.</p>

<p>One really does not have to go to any coaching center or to subscribe to  their costly preparatory materials. Get previous examination papers and  solve them. Start early (say late December) and solve one or two  problems from each section every day. But one must solve them completely. No cheating. If a  problem takes 7 days, give it to that monster. If you are not solving  tough problems, you are just bullshitting. Why would you solve a problem  which is easy. This means you already know it. Solving easy problem is  cheating. Do not do that. Save them for exams! Keep  problem solving going on till neural path in your brain align themselves to suit  GATE.</p>

<p>No one is suppose to read everything. If you have attended only few classes  in your course work and teacher was worse than the worst which is usually true in 2nd tier institutes then you must give your course book an easy reading. Just to make  sure you know where '<em>this and that</em>' concept is. Use books as reference material and not as a story book. 'Reading book' is your  girlfriend, 'solving problem' is your wife. You are allowed to spend  time with both. Divide your time carefully that meets need of your life.  But don't do that in real life. Actually you can! See, here problems  reside in book, by that logic, your wife must reside in your girlfriend. Then there is no problem.</p>

<p>So bottom-line is that after watching latest animated movie, buy previous  years papers and solve them. When I say 'solve it'; I really mean solve  it. No matter how simple a problem look like. Convince yourself that you  understood it. It'd be a good idea if you masturbate before you start  solving, so that chances of distraction will be minimum. Stay away from  Internet, even if you have some e-affair going on. Or at least try to  refrain. Of course, there is time and place for everything.</p>

<p>Everyone is smart enough to understand that '<strong>in the end, what you think and what you  feel is of little value</strong>'. Your feeling and thoughts should shape your work; that what ultimately counts. Don't run into nihilism that there is no point in anything. What you do or have done,  ultimately, will be insignificant but it is very important that you do  it. Not only because it is useful but also If you do not occupy yourself with something productive then you'll  have the luxury of time to think over whether you are happy or sad. And this is  exactly when life starts getting boring and miserable. I have added few  arguments on top of what Shaw and Gandhi have argued.</p>

<p>And by the way, I know what I am talking about. Trust me!</p>

<p>PS : If ignorance is bliss then why so many people are not happy. -- Thomas Jefferson.</p>

<p>As usual. All the best.</p>
