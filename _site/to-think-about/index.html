    <h2>To think about</h2>

	<div class="entry"><blockquote><p><strong>The intellect of man is forced to choose
Perfection of life or his art
If its the later he must refuse
A heavenly mansion raging in the dark.</strong>
Andre Beteille</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>A great many things can be done with your life if you decide to die poor. --</strong><a href="http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~dinesh/#interests">Prof. Dinesh K. Sharma</a></p>

<blockquote></blockquote>

<p><strong>The more "successful" your education, the more likely you are to feel alone, because the process of segregation has been more complete. Just a few of you are academics like myself. 11+, O level, A Level, College Entrance, Degree class, Ph.D.... at every stage you proved how much cleverer you are than all those other fellows, until in the end you stand quite alone and afraid -- </strong>Edmucd Leach, A Runaway World?, BBC 1968, p73</p>

<blockquote></blockquote>

<p><strong>The mind of a man is far from the nature of a clear and equal glass, wherein the beam of things should reflect according to their true incidence: nay, it is rather like a enchanted glass, full of superstition and imposture -- </strong>Francis Beacon</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>My practice as a scientist is atheistic. That is to say, when I set up an experiment I assume that no god, angel, or devil is going to interfere with its course; and this assumption has been justified by such success as I have achieved in my professional career. I should therefore be intellectually dishonest if I were not also atheistic in the affairs of the world. -- </strong>J B S Haldane</p>

<p><strong>The voice of the intellect is a soft one, but it does not rest until it has gained a hearing. -- </strong>Sigmund Freud</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>The wise man reads both books and life itself.</strong>.. and ..
<strong>All women's dresses are merely variations on the eternal struggle between the admitted desire to dress and the unadmitted desire to undress.</strong>-- Lin Yutang</p>

<p><strong>When I carefully consider the curious habits of dogs</strong>
<strong> I am compelled to conclude</strong>
<strong> That man is the superior animal.</strong></p>

<p><strong>When I consider the curious habits of man</strong>
<strong> I confess, my friend, I am puzzled.</strong>
-- An old Chinese poem</p>
