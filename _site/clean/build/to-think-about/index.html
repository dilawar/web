    <h2>To think about</h2>

	<div class="entry"><blockquote><p>The intellect of man is forced to choose</p>

<p>Perfection of life or his art</p>

<p>If its the later he must refuse</p>

<p>A heavenly mansion raging in the dark.</p></blockquote>

<p align="right">-- Andre Beteille</p>


<blockquote><p>A great many things can be done with your life if you decide to die poor.
-- <a href="http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~dinesh/#interests">Prof. Dinesh K. Sharma</a></p>

<p>The more "successful" your education, the more likely you are to feel alone,
because the process of segregation has been more complete. Just a few of you are
academics like myself. 11+, O level, A Level, College Entrance, Degree class,
Ph.D.... at every stage you proved how much cleverer you are than all those
other fellows, until in the end you stand quite alone and afraid.</p></blockquote>

<p align="right">-- Edmucd Leach, A Runaway World?, BBC 1968, p73</p>


<blockquote><p>The mind of a man is far from the nature of a clear and equal glass, wherein
the beam of things should reflect according to their true incidence: nay, it is
rather like a enchanted glass, full of superstition and imposture.</p></blockquote>

<p align="right">-- Francis Beacon</p>


<blockquote><p>My practice as a scientist is atheistic. That is to say, when I set up an
experiment I assume that no god, angel, or devil is going to interfere with
its course; and this assumption has been justified by such success as I have
achieved in my professional career. I should therefore be intellectually
dishonest if I were not also atheistic in the affairs of the world.</p></blockquote>

<p align="right">-- J B S  Haldane</p>


<blockquote><p>The voice of the intellect is a soft one, but it does not rest until it has
gained a hearing.</p></blockquote>

<p align="right">-- Sigmund Freud</p>


<blockquote><p>The wise man reads both books and life itself.</p>

<p>All women's
dresses are merely variations on the eternal struggle between the admitted
desire to dress and the unadmitted desire to undress.</p></blockquote>

<p align="right">-- Lin Yutang</p>


<blockquote><p>When I carefully consider the curious habits of dogs</p>

<p>I am compelled to conclude</p>

<p>That man is the superior animal.</p>

<p>When I consider the curious habits of man</p>

<p>I confess, my friend, I am puzzled.</p></blockquote>

<p align="right">-- An old Chinese poem</p>
