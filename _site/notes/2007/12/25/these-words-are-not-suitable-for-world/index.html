        <div class="entry"><p>Ever wonder why we are not advancing in the direction of fundamental discoveries. Most of the basic concepts we are imbibing are well established.  Whatever i have studied till now, i dont think there is any fundamental breakthrough made in this century. Yes we have done a lot in technology but that is the application of thoughts/theories. And it seems to be the these days that applications (technology) are influencing the basic research.<br/>
Personally, i feel before this century or rather before the advent of printing press, world was obviously isolated and of course most of the researchers was not in touch with each other. What they think, they premises new theories on them. Most of the thoughts were of course original and hence new to other thinkers. Their thinking was not subjugated to what books told them.  When they get published , they influenced  others and hence helped them improving and liberating their ideas.  Early childhood of those great thinkers must have been spent without books. Books, here mean, a well defined literature published over a significant area. I do not mean notes in any bounded form given by they teacher, they must be called notes. I do not if i am right, just a thought.  Whatever they learned must have been carrying the impression that that is not absolute. Now these days mostly and  indirectly, these books insist that whatever they are having blackened on them are absolute. unfortunately most of the authors write their books in that sense only that whatever is knew can not be replaced with alternatives. The examination system is making these things worse by disseminating these kind of thought among children. Do you really think the problem they ask in exams can be solved only in the way they taught in the class? i dont think so! this should not happen. How much foolish it may seem, new approaches must be appreciated. I know i am not convincing enough, but these 26 letters i dont find enough to explain everything. A universal language should be constructed which deliver the same essence of you, no matter written or spoken or whatever. If you have ever did chat on internet, u must have felt it that a same sentence may have totally different meaning in online and offline world. Emotions or rather gestures must not facilitate the subject to decipher the meaning of worlds being spoken, there must be a certainty of meaning irrespective of other things.  Well, i'll improve this blog later, thats the idea just came in. I wrote it so i dont forget it. C u all later...</p>
