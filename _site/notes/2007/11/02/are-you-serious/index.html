        <div class="entry"><p>I am facing a real dilemma, how you feel when you are surrounded by really SERIOUS people who not just look serious, talk serious, may be think serious and perhaps eat serious. Most importantly, they give me a serious look, worse than my mother used to give me whenever I forgot my schoolbag in primary school in early childhood. It really patrified me. Not even students, prof here also the same with  some exception of course. Well i am not going to talk about them, i am still here and don't want to be thrown out of the IIT right away.<br/>
Now i am really serious about this seriousness, i want to think about it. What really seriousness is? Why think when you have wikipedia around. i checked it, it is also not that much serious, nothing is there. Then dictionary.com, " <em>requiring effort or concentration; complex and not easy to answer or solve</em>". oops, if it is seriousness, then in MPD class i am damn serious, but most of the people say they get serious to solve some problem, not to just get confused, so i am not serious in MPD class. honestly, i feel only one thing about being serious, when people are around and you are serious, then you want to show your importance or difference, if you are alone and you are serious, then your life is miserable or perhaps out of track. When you are serious while you are studying or working, then you want to fool yourself that you can do better than you can really do. In any case I dont find it honest to be serious in any part of life.<br/>
Confusing thing about it that everyone has a diffirent definition of seriousness.  So i think its futile to carry on this thing which is subjective.</p>
