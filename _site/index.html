		<div class="entry"><p>Social life in India is marked by subordination of individual to the group. This
is not to say that Indian society knows "anything of individuals" but the claims
of group often prevail of claim of an individual [1]. Family, being a universal
social group, is a good candidate for comparison and contrast. An Indian family
makes its claims most vigorously at the time when education and marriage of
children are being arranged. Such claims legitimize themselves by a value-system
based on customs. Customs justify themselves by asserting their antiquity over
anything else. If a group makes its claim on individual and expect from him a
moral obligation to be loyal to it, then in return it offers patronage and a
sense of security. Majority of Indians who feel safe and secure only in some
"group" or extended kinship develop a deep urge to be identified with a group :
Jats, Brahmins, Tamils, Gujrati, IITians, IIMians etc. I do not wish to comment
on identities based on language or religion for they are universal but I wish to
point out those groups which are unique to South Asia namely Caste and its
modern avatars.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>One of our historians noted the lack of taste for accurate historical writing
rather ruefully. 'India, for its great literary heritage', noted D. D.  Kosambi,
'has produced no historical writers comparable to Herodotus,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides">Thucydides</a>, Polybius, Livy, Tacitus'.
This is despite of the fact that many Indian kings of the middle ages were  not
only 'incomparably superior in their education and literally ability to
contemporary rulers in Europe', they also 'personally led great armies to
victory in heavy warfare'. None of them considered it worthwhile to write
anything comparable to Caesar's Commentaries or Xenophon's Anabasis. 'The
tradition was of graceful court drama, an occasional hymn in praise of the gods,
or a witty epigram'.  Kosambi commented further that only Rajatarangani by a
Kasmirian named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalhana">Kalhana</a>  (A.D.  1149-50)
and continued by two successors can be called anything like a historical
document. Unfortunately, 'this chronicles suffer from all the mannered
conventions of Sanskrit poetry, in particular the fatal double entendre that
manages only to obscure whatever reality the author meant to portray'. Even when
the period Kalhana was describing was 'a period was of desperate struggle
between the central power and feudal lords in Kashmir', he cared not to note the
'actual time and place' which can 'hardly be compared in quality, depth, content
to the account by Thucydides of the Peloponnesian war'. For the rest of the
country, till the Muslim period, we have nothing even as good as Kalhana. Some
older written records which survived such as Puranas ( = the ancient stories),
'are only religious fables and cant with whatever historical content the works
once possessed heavily encrusted by myth, diluted with semi-religious legends,
effaced during successive redactions copied by innumerable, careless scribes'.
Forget constructing the past from it, one can not even make 'as must as
king-lists' [1].</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Our newspapers are filled with articles and news-reports where all sorts of accusations and allegations can be found. People in India, like people in many other countries, were not any less enthusiastic in the past for lashing out at their politicians, bureaucrats or any public-office holder but the style and content of this activity has been changed greatly by Internet and media. It is more common these days to find people accusing not only public figures but also their colleagues for some wrong or corrupt conduct.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>A growing tendency in India is to attack secularism, covertly and indirectly. The attack on secularism is somewhat similar to the attack on equality. They maintain since we can not define secularism (like equality) in a strict sense, it will be good if we stop using the term altogether, at least to avoid the intellectual confusion. More adventurous among them will go on to say that it does not exists at all and everything which is called secular is a form of pseudo-secular. <!-- more -->In addition, they may also argue that many people those who speak in the name of the secularism are not strictly secular. Similarly, as one would say against equality, all those who speaks in the name of equality do not practice equality. Indeed, one can easily show that many of them practice in private just opposite of what they preach in public. But can we take these inconsistencies in the practices of these secularists against the idea of secularism itself? It yes, then it is easy to show that those who maintain that religion is a good thing often use it to achieve some other ends. Then, it is pseudo-religion which exists and therefore we must stop using the term altogether? We can drive a term to a logical nihilism but it will be a counsel of despair. Besides a meaning has to be given to secularism, even if it does not exists in strict sense for it has made its way into our constitution.</p>

To me, who has an impressionable young mind, he is capable of giving few sleepless nights. He mixes psychology and philosophy with sociology to a magical effect. I can not imagine anyone who would read him without being deeply influenced. His collection of essays '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intimate-Enemy-Recovery-Under-Colonialism/dp/0195622375%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0195622375">The intimate enemy</a>' (and other works too) have decolonized some minds. His work continues to have a deep impact on South Asian intellectual culture. He is surely one of the finest public intellectuals of our time.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>That men do cruel things to women is widely acknowledged and accepted. What is often concealed, not always in innocence, is that woman cruelty towards woman is no less compared to men's cruelty to women. This is not to condone any sort of violence to anyone but to draw attention to a fact. It has been pointed out that most of the female fetus abandoned or killed in India are due maternal neglect. Moreover, those who persuade or force mother to abandon a girl child; the doctor or the dai who does these operations are usually woman. This is a weird but strong statement on women hostility towards womanhood. This is also a classic case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_mechanism">psychological defense mechanism</a> in which the victim starts identifying with his or her aggressor and turned against himself or herself. It needs attention to the ways in which social institutes turn men and women against womenhood. And the purpose of this post to scratch the surface of this issue.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>After completing my Masters at IIT Bombay and before joining my new job at Noida, I was at home when my mother asked me about my classmates : where are they and what are they doing. I told her that I know few of them and  most of them are in 'videsh' (read Europe or US) for work or higher studies. On this she made a pitiful face and said with a deep sympathy, ‘Ha! Aur tu yahi rah gaya!’ (Ha!  And you remained here [in India].) Anyone who has taken any of his degree from a reputed Indian campus know how ubiquitous and strong such expectation is in our style of society. It comes from not only parents but also <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrWvPAUwn1I">larger society</a>. The love for ‘videsh’ is immense in rural India but it is no less intense in the most self-congratulatory class of our society, namely our intellectuals, though many of them love to criticize West.</p>

This email was written for anyone  'who is concerned with IIT Bombay future'. Thus I read it. The sender is a member of student body. He was disappointed with the little interests shown by IIT Bombay student community for the debate on new single entrance examination proposed of Government of India. The sender was aware that this mailing list is not meant for such message but he made his case by claiming that 'desperate times need desperate measures'. This shows how deep feelings are running in some of them.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>For last few decades, many scholars of Indian history have started to argue, sometimes with official patronage, that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization">Indus civilization</a> was not only Aryan, but also Vedic or even post-Vedic. To make their view credible they tried to prove, among other things, that the '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda">Rigveda</a>' was composed around 3500 BC, a date contemporaneous to with the Indus civilization. Their opponents claim that these proponents usually reject the entire method of dating by linguistics comparisons. Two enthusiasts even invented the evidence by <a href="http://www.flonnet.com/fl1720/17200040.htm">forging an Indus seal</a>. These deplorable methods apart, the positive arguments advanced for a very early date of the 'Rigveda' are two-fold : one based on river Sarasvati and other on astronomical data. This note is about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasvati_River">Sarasvati river</a>. For the matter of Indian astronomy, one  would benefit greatly by reading the chapter titled 'Indian Calender' in the book 'Argumentative Indians' by Prof. Amartya Kumar Sen.

Cricket had a very large following in India, even <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/651075">before independence. It had influenced Indian politics</a> to a much larger extent than Indian historian have written about it. Cricket came to India with British who played it to amuse themselves in an alien land. An acute observer of British ways, Nirad Chaudhary, once remarked that to Englishman abroad, literature was his wife and sport his mistress. Books and games provided twin consolations by which he came to terms with an alien - and potentially hostile - culture and environment. 'Two monsoons', it was said, was all that colonial would expect to live through.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>I am not of the view that most of us join an educational institute for the sake of knowledge only. I also find it unconvincing that an educational institute is build solely for the purpose of 'spreading knowledge'; no matter what their motto is. There will be few among us who are driven solely by the desire of learning, criticizing existing and producing new knowledge. For rest of us there are certain benefits to be harnessed; employment and social status being the most prominent one. A young desires both. Thus a large flock of young humanity tries to get into educational institutes. No educational institute, especially in South Asia, can accommodate all applicants it receives. So it looks for a tool to discriminate among its perspective students. The most ubiquitous tool for this purpose is believed to be competition.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Perhaps it is due to incapabilities of human mind in handling more than 5 or 6 details at a time that abstraction is born. Now there a tendency to glorify abstraction by which one squeeze details into a small representable quantity. No doubt abstraction is useful. It definitely make sense to write down eigen values of a big matrix or a huge graph and pass comment on them. But should we made 'the ultimate abstract' as the holy grail of intellectualism? Why should the ability to 'abstract out' ideas should be taken as a sign of ultimate intelligence? If abstraction is to be used, it should be used to make sense out of enormous amount of details, to find connections. What possible use it might have otherwise rather than driving someone into a metaphysical world, a incoherent land of plenty invented by crazy minds.</p>

<p>One should admire, or at least respect, details. After all, the meaningful world is made up of details. It may bring spiritual satisfaction to some who pursue abstraction for the sake of abstraction. But for those who are more concerned with fruits of real world, we must take the details head on. Surely it would definitely help to use abstraction as a potent weapon unless computers are fast enough for brute force algorithms.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>'The Pariah dog', wrote an acute observer of Indian ways, 'has always been on downhill slope of popular contempt'.  Natives ignore his 'novel potentialities of his characters' and discourage him by 'keeping him at a distance'. He is denied affection to which its British counterpart has a social claim. The Pariah dog longs for a master; a mere approving look touches a chord is it heart. Compared with English dog, says Kipling,  'the poor Indian outcast is a pagan, a creature without faith, or at least without that soul-saving reverence for authority which ennobles character' and concluded rightly that 'the Pariah does not know the joy of adoration' for he has no master.

		<div class="entry"><p>Following table is an outcome of notes taken for sole purpose of generalising Left and Right politics. Left politics is usually confused with ideology of some political parties. Such views of politics in popular media are confusing if not contradictory. The distinction made between Left and Right was of French origin where  the Left is called "the party of movement" and the Right "the party of order". To be sure, there is no black-and-white distinction between these two political culture. It is often the case that a Right wing party takes a Leftist stand on one issue and a Left-wing party takes Rightist stand on another. However there are differences between these two culture which can not be denied.</p>

<p>In India, parenting and childcare is not perceived as something which can have socio-political colours. We include it here. In our media, the idea of politic is poorly debated. The popular belief - that 'politics is what a politician does' - is widespread. It should not be surprising since the idea of 'politics' is often confused with its Hindustani word 'Rajneeti' (codes of ruling).</p>

		<div class="entry"><p><strong>Daughter</strong></p>

<p>The theory goes like that English 'daughter', German 'Tochter',  Greek 'thygater', Irish 'dear', Lithuanian 'dukte', Russian 'doch', are  common derivation with the Sankrit root 'duh' (to milk), so the word  was, according to this theory, originally 'dogdhri' = she who milks, to  indicate that it was the daughter of a primitive aryan family who did  the milking. This charming picture was first drawn by Lassen, quoted  with approval by Max Muller, plagiarised by various Indian authors in  deservedly obscure writings, re-adopted from Marathi and have now gain  an unforseen sanctity by the virtue omission and commission during translation. [ref : Max  Muller, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24686">Chips from a german workshop</a> (2 vol, London 1868, vol II, pp 22-26)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it still fail to explain why Aryan languages  preserved a common word for 'she who milks' without preserving a common  word for 'milk'. It is worthy to note in passing that pastoral  life was admitted to be patriarchal and milking the cow comes at a very  late stage. So it would not be primitive Aryan, let alone being a woman  who milked the cow. It has also been remarked by derisive philologists  that there exists a common root-derivation for 'foot' but none for  'hand' in India-Iranian languages, whence same theory is consistently  applied would demand that unseparated Aryan possessed feet, but not  hands, which must have sprouted after they are separated. [1]<br/>
<strong><br/>
</strong><br/>
<strong>Devata and God</strong></p>

<p>In [2], nowhere author mention a distinction between God and devata. Also, as far as  I understand, God is usually taken a singular while devata are always  plural. The other word 'Bhagwan' which Wiki says means "possessing  fortune, blessed, prosperous" also does not fit the definition of 'God'  as we like to see it these days.</p>

<p>According to this book, devata is connected with light, intelligence  ([2] does not cite any source); and later etymologists have connected it  with the root 'to give' which makes sense when one consider a Hindi  saying 'Devi to deti hi hai." but it also does not fit the the idea of  God. So is old 'devata' were those who gave some materials?</p>

<p>Such an materialistic interpretation from an early civilisation make sense. These days 'Gods' or 'devata' is connected with spiritual sense. However, one wonders why Indian still offer money to god! Isn't it hight of materialism in the idea of God? It would be interesting to know when such spiritual  conception of God came into being in our civilisation (in any civilisation)? Reading D.D.  Koshambi gives an impression that RgVeda mainly (only?) have  materialistic interpretation ([1], chap 4, pp80). So how come people start taking of soul. Unless a civilization produces a surplus which  some of its member can appropriate by some cult  or custom, thus having a lot of free time to think over, I don't think one could afford to think about soul (let  alone having one)!<br/>

<strong>Idea of Devata</strong></p>

<p>'Deva' seem to have been derived from 'divyanti' (devam dhyuti krida va  tavanti tevtah). Also in AmarSimha, synonym of Deva have been cited such  as amar, nijjar (never ageing), tridhasa (growth, maturity and waste  does not affect them), vivudha (always awake), suparvan (with nice  tapering fingers), sumans (because they accomplish what they desire),  lekha (because their palms and neck are nicely marked by lines, not  corny by manual work).</p>

<p>The root 'de' is not very far from the explanation of the  commentator who says 'dataro abhimtana bhaktebhya :' . Another  derivation which follows this 'tejaswat diptya va' and he adds 'artha:  saman: | div sambanidhno va deva". Further the entry says 'dhytthana  ityartha: deva rashmaya uchyate ||"</p>

<strong>Sankrit Translation</strong></p>

<p><em>(This is for those who does not like the idea of Westerner studying Indian sacred text because the meaning is often lost in Sanskrit translation).</em><strong><br/>
</strong><br/>
One of the most wonderful property of Sankrit has been its formal  grammar which is contained in two books : rules of grammar in  'ashtadhyayi' and root words in 'amarkosha'. It is the first known work  of 'context free grammar' or Noam Chomsky forms. When one takes the root  words and apply a rule to forms new words. If you wonder how one can construct 330 million gods and give them distinct names, it is your clue! On these lines, it is very  hard to agree that translation of Sankrit can be very ambiguous (if  done properly), whether done by a Indian or a non-Indian. If I take the  liberty to exaggerate, It'd be like saying that a C-program will behave  differently if compiled by an Indian or American. However, there is no  denial that root words do often change their meanings over time.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Over years, quality of fiction may have gone down a bit. There are few equivalents of Rabindranath Tagore, George Orwell and Tolstoy. But the quality of  awards surely have nosedived. The Observer, writing in its editorial two days ago  wonders if 'James Joyce have ever made the Man Booker shortlist?' We  all know that its NO! If wonders 'if the current crop of judges had anything to  do with it.' May be one would have expected '<em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em>' to be on the list, but '<em>Ulysses</em>?  Not a chance'. Observer laments that '<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/oct/16/observer-editorial-man-booker-prize">Readability is the watchword of this year's panel</a>'.</p>

<p>Why there is such a decline? If the awards the reflecting the taste of consumer then one wonders if taste of generation have gone down?  Often tastes of generation changes dramatically. A novel Lolita, banned  by one generation was awarded Nobel Prize by the next. So a  generation dirt could become next generation art! But how about changes during a  generation. Why like of Dan Brown and Paulo Coelho replace Orhan Pamuk  or R K Narayanan?</p>

<p>Guardian thinks that, '<em>maybe it says something about our culture that it has become strangely  unfashionable to suggest that great novels shouldn't only be a quick  fix, another consumer experience, that they should make us work and  reward us for our effort by staying with us, leaving a bit of  intellectual and emotional residue.</em>' Well, lover of Chetan Bhagat and his ilk have always argued on these lines.</p>

<p>For  ordinary 'people like us' its hard to understand the difference between  mediocrity and genius. In fact, when I was 18, Dan Brown tasted much  better than R K Narayanan. Today, it is not possible for me to say confidently why 'The White Tiger' has to  win over 'Sea of Poppies' in 2008. Both tasted equally good to me. And their critics  did not make much sense to me either. But one fact about Booker I can  surely question, why a MI5-cop, a politician and two journalists have to  be on the jury while the best of literary figures, well suited to  recognise and award their peers, are available? After all, award is the  recognition of one's achievements by one's peer, not a thing which has  to be influenced by the forces of market! Or are they?</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>In 2010, Guardian published <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/mar/13/obesity-salt-fat-sugar-kessler">an article</a> written by Food and Drug Administration <br/>
(FDA) commissioner  Dr. David Kessler. This article is no longer on Guardian since their copyright on it has expired. A simple googling will still reveal some other sources. SOME EXCERPTS:</p>

<p>THE LIE</p>

<p>For years I wondered why I was fat. I lost weight, gained it back, and lost it again – over and over and over. I owned suits in every size. As a former commissioner of the FDA (the US Food and Drug Administration), surely I should have the answer to my problems. Yet food held remarkable sway over my behaviour.</p>

<p>MORE LIES</p>

<p>The latest science seemed to suggest being overweight was my destiny. I was fat because my body's "thermostat" was set high. If I lost weight, my body would try to get it back, slowing down my metabolism till I returned to my predetermined set point.</p>

<p>SOME FACTS</p>

<p>But this theory didn't explain why so many people, in the US and UK in particular, were getting significantly fatter. <strong>For thousands of years,  human body weight had stayed remarkably stable. Millions of calories passed through our bodies, yet with rare exceptions our weight neither  rose nor fell. A perfect biological system seemed to be at work. Then, <br/>
in the 80s, something changed.</strong></p>

<p>During the past 20 years there has been a dramatic increase in obesity  in the United States. What had happened to add so many millions of pounds to so many  millions of people? Certainly food had become more readily available, with larger portion sizes, more chain restaurants and a culture that promotes out-of-home eating. But having food available doesn't mean we have to eat it. What has been driving us to overeat?</p>

<p>A REASON</p>

<p>"Higher sugar, fat and salt make you want to eat more." I had read  this in scientific literature, and heard it in conversations with neuroscientists and psychologists. But here was <strong>a leading food designer, a Henry Ford of mass-produced food, revealing how his industry operates. To protect his business, he did not want to be identified, but he was remarkably candid, explaining how the food industry creates dishes to hit what he called the "three points of the compass".</strong></p>

<p>The ultra-high levels of fat make food easier to chew, whereby <strong>faster  bypasses normal feelings of satiation. People addicted to the such foods tend to gorge. Sugar, fat and salt make a food compelling</strong>. They  stimulate neurons, cells that trigger the brain's reward system and <strong>release dopamine, a chemical that motivates our behaviour and makes us want to eat more</strong>. Many of us have what's called a "bliss point", at which we get the greatest pleasure from sugar, fat or salt. Combined in the right way, they make a product indulgent, high in "hedonic value". <br/>
_<br/>
So when McDonald ad says, "I am loving it". For once, they are not lying. _</p>

<hr />

<p>During the past two decades, there has been an explosion in our  ability to access and afford what scientists call highly "palatable" foods. *By palatability, they don't just mean it tastes good: they are referring primarily to its capacity to stimulate the appetite. * Restaurants sit at the epicentre of this explosion, along with an ever-expanding range of dishes that hit these three compass points.  Sugar, fat and salt are either loaded into a core ingredient (such as meat, vegetables, potato or bread), layered on top of it, or both. Deep-fried tortilla chips are an example of loading – the fat is contained in the chip itself. When it is smothered in cheese, sour cream and sauce, that's layering.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Combined in the right way, sugar, fat and salt act like a drug. They stimulate neurons, cells that trigger the brain's reward system and  release dopamine, a chemical that makes us want to eat more. </strong>Take Kentucky Fried Chicken. My source called it "a premier example" of putting more fat on our plate. KFC's approach to battering its food  results in "an optimised fat pick-up system". With its flour, salt, MSG, maltodextrin, sugar, corn syrup and spice, the fried coating imparts flavour that touches on all three points of the compass while giving the consumer the perception of a bargain – a big plate of food at a good price.</p>

<hr />

<p>Initially, KFC meals were built around a whole chicken, with a pick-up  surface that contained "an enormous amount of breading, crispiness and  brownness on the surface. That makes the chicken look like more and gives it this wonderful oily flavour." Over time, the company began to realise there was less meat in a chicken nugget compared with a whole chicken, and a greater percentage of fried batter. But the real breakthrough was popcorn chicken. "The smaller the piece of meat, the greater the percentage of fat pick-up," said the food designer. "Now, we have lots of pieces of a cheaper part of the chicken." The product  has been "optimised on every dimension", with the fat, sugar and salt combining with the perception of good value virtually to guarantee consumer appeal.</p>

<hr />

<p>This kind of food disappears down our throats so quickly after the first bite that it readily overrides the body's signals that should tell us, "I'm full." The food designer offered coleslaw as an example. When its ingredients are chopped roughly, it requires time and energy to chew. But when cabbage and carrots are softened in a high-fat dressing, coleslaw ceases to be "something with a lot of innate ability to satisfy".</p>

<hr />

<p>This isn't to say that the food industry wants us to stop chewing  altogether. It knows we want to eat a doughnut, not drink it. "<em>The key is to create foods with just enough chew – but not too much. When you're eating these things, you've had 500, 600, 800, 900 calories before you know it</em>." Foods that slip down don't leave us with a sense of being well fed. In making food disappear so swiftly, fat and sugar only leave us wanting more.</p>

<hr />

<p>According to food consultant Gail Vance Civille, of management  consultants Sensory Spectrum, <strong>fat is crucial to this process of lubrication, ensuring that a product melts in the mouth. In the past,  she says, Americans typically chewed food up to 25 times before it was  swallowed; now the average American chews 10 times. "If I have fat in there, I just chew it up and whoosh! Away it goes," she says. "You have a 'quick getaway', a quick melt.</strong>"</p>

<p>A deep fried Snickers bar, another popular American treat.  The Snickers bar, Civille says, is "extraordinarily well engineered". Unlike many products whose nuts become annoyingly lodged between your teeth, the genius of Snickers is that as we chew, the sugar dissolves, the fat melts and the caramel picks up the peanut pieces, so the entire candy is carried out of the mouth at the same time. "You're not getting a build-up of stuff in your mouth."</p>

<hr />

<p>The complexity of the stimulus increases its association to a reward.  Elements of that complexity include tastes that are familiar and well liked, and the learning associated with having had a pleasurable experience with the same food in the past. When layers of complexity are built into food, the effect becomes more  powerful. Sweetness alone does not account for the full impact of a fizzy drink – its temperature and tingle, resulting from the stimulation of the trigeminal nerve by carbonation and acid, are essential contributors as well.</p>

<p><strong>"The complexity of the stimulus increases its association to a  reward," says Gaetano Di Chiara, an expert in neuroscience and pharmacology at the University of Cagliari in Italy. Elements of that complexity include tastes that are familiar and well liked, especially if not always readily available, and the learning associated with having had a pleasurable experience with the same food in the past. <br/>
</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>In theory there's a limit to how much stimulation rewarding foods can <br/>
generate. We are supposed to habituate – to neuroadapt. When Di Chiara <br/>
gave animals a cheesy snack called Fonzies, the levels of dopamine in <br/>
their brains increased. Over time, habituation set in, dopamine levels <br/>
fell and the food lost its capacity to activate their behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>But if the stimulus is powerful enough, novel enough or administered <br/>
intermittently enough, the brain may not curb its dopamine response. <br/>
Desire remains high. We see this with cocaine use, which does not <br/>
result in habituation. Hyperpalatable foods alter the landscape of the <br/>
brain in much the same way. <br/>
</strong></p>

<p>I asked Di Chiara to study what happens after an animal is repeatedly exposed to a high-sugar, high-fat chocolate drink. When he'd completed his experiment, he sent me an email with "Important results!!!!" in the subject line. *He had shown that dopamine response did not diminish over time with the chocolate drink. <strong>There was no habituation. </strong></p>

<p>Novelty also impedes habituation, and intermittency is another driver.  Give an animal enough sugar-laden food, withdraw it for the right amount of time, then provide it again in sufficient quantities, and dopamine levels may not diminish.</p>

<p>Rewarding foods are rewiring our brains. As they do, we become more  sensitive to the cues that lead us to anticipate the reward. In that circularity lies a trap: we can no longer control our responses to highly palatable foods because our brains have been changed by the foods we eat.</p>

<p>I wanted to know how much the industry understood about how the food  we eat affects us; about what I have termed "conditioned hypereating" – "conditioned" because it becomes an automatic response to widely available food, "hyper" because the eating is excessive and hard to control. I turned to Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate in economics.</p>

<p>"Does the industry know that what it feeds us gets us to eat more?" I asked.  The industry has jacked up what works for it," Stiglitz said. "The learning is evolutionary." Practical experience has been its guide – it does not need lab rats when it can try out its ideas on humans. Its decision-makers do not have to analyse human brain circuitry to  discover what sells." There's still a lot we don't know about the  relationship between the dopamine-driven motivational system and our  behaviour in the presence  of rewarding foods. But we do know that foods  high in sugar, fat and salt are altering the biological circuitry of  our brains. We have  scientific techniques that demonstrate how  these foods – and the cues  associated with them – change the  connections between the neural circuits and their response patterns.</p>

<hr />

<p>XXXXXlearned a basic lesson: make enticing food easily and  constantly available, keep it novel, and people will keep coming back for more. With food available in almost any setting, "the number of cues, the number of opportunities"* to eat have increased, while the barriers to consumption have fallen, says David Mela, senior scientist of weight management at the Unilever Health Institute. "The environmental stimulus has changed."</p>

<p>Of course, when food is offered to us, we're not obliged to eat it.  When it's on the menu, we don't have to order it. But this takes more than willpower. As an individual, you can practise eating the food you want in a controlled way. As a society, we can identify the forces  that drive overeating and find ways to diminish their power. <strong>That's what happened with the tobacco industry: attitudes to smoking shifted. Similar changes could be brought about in our attitudes to food – by  making it mandatory for restaurants to list calorie counts on their menus; by clear labelling on food products; by monitoring food marketing. But until then few of us are immune to the ubiquitous presence of food, the incessant marketing and the cultural assumption that it's acceptable to eat anywhere, at any time. </strong></p>

<p>Call it the "taco chip challenge" – the challenge of controlled eating in the face of constant food availability. "Forty years ago, you might face the social equivalent of that taco chip challenge once a month. Now you face it every single day," Mela said. "Every single day and every single place you go, those foods are there, those foods are cheap, those foods are readily available for you to engage in. There is constant, constant opportunity."</p>

<p>UPDATE :</p>

<p>In U.S. McDonalds was asked to put calories in its menu which it did. There has been some hostility towards it in government.  <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/sep/14/us-health-ad-targets-mcdonalds&amp;usg=AFQjCNEEl9Hz7PY-GAYWM-tuouzWmGbkBA">http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/sep/14/us-health-ad-targets-m...</a> Now, McD is aiming towards India and other countries where lack of knowledge  and pressure  to emulate Western culture is significantly high. India media has taken a  agnostic view over it alltogether.  Partly due to 'no one care', and mostly due to 'advertisements' revenues.</p>

<p>END NOTES : <br/>
[1] A few indian newspaper have devoted space for food related issues. <br/>
Though there  are not mainstream. I am a reader of Hindu so my knowledge about other  papers are limited.  Hindu has been writing about 'salt intake' <br/>
<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/article62167.ece&amp;usg=AFQjCNEt-CQ8EGLNNdrYnqimFysyAZk44w">http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/article62167.ece</a> which increases blood pressure and causes heart attacks.</p>

<p>[2] In India, emphasis of public debate has been on 'food security'. Nothing <br/>
much is available in learned journal about the 'food policies of gov. of India'.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>It took a man like <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/article2523649.ece?homepage=true">Sainath to</a> break the story of paid news in public in the newspaper The Hindu.</p>

<p>PCI (Press council of India) made a committee to look into the matter of paid news which came down heavily on 'the big guys'. The report they submitted named the names which the 'big guys' did not like. They successfully buried its report - in the watered down version of this report, original report was reduced to a footnote. Some excerpts from this original report were made available by <a href="http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?266542">Outlook magazine</a>.</p>

<p>Delhi High Court has asked to made this report public on PCI website in response to an RTI by Oct 10, 2011. It has not done it so far (at the time writing this blog). There was no response from PCI to an email I sent.</p>

<p>SOME EXCERPTS :</p>

<p>In recent years, corruption in the Indian media has gone way beyond the corruption of individual journalists and specific media organizations -- from “planting” information and views in lieu of favours received in cash or kind, to more institutionalized and organized forms of corruption wherein newspapers and television channels receive funds for publishing or broadcasting information in favour of particular individuals, corporate entities, representatives of political parties and candidates contesting elections, that is sought to be disguised as “news”.</p>

<p>...<br/>
This report tracks the blurring boundaries between news and advertisements/advertorialsand highlights the efforts made by individuals and representatives of organizations whohave painstakingly chronicled the selling of editorial space for money during elections</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The entire operation is clandestine. This malpractice has become widespread and now cuts across newspapers and television channels, small and large, in different languages and located in various parts of the country. What is worse, these illegal operations have become “organized” and involve advertising agencies and public relations firms, besides journalists, managers and owners of media companies. Marketing executives use the services of journalists – willingly or otherwise – to gain access to political personalities. So-called “rate cards” or “packages” are distributed that often include “rates” for publication of “news” items that not merely praise particular candidates but also criticize their political opponents. Candidates who do not go along with such “extortionist” practices on the part of media organizations are denied coverage.</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>The regulator of the country’s capital markets, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), has written to the Press Council of India on the issue of “private treaties” between media companies and other corporate entities and suggested disclosure of financial holdings and mandatory enforcement of guidelines to ensure that the interests of investors are adequately safeguarded – these suggestions have been endorsed by the Press Council of India which, in 1996, drew up a set of guidelines that are particularly applicable to financial journalists.</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>Identical articles with photographs and headlines have appeared in competing publications carrying bylines of different authors around the same time. On the same page of specific newspapers, articles have been printed praising competing candidates claiming that both are likely to win the same elections. Nowhere is there any indication that the publication of such “news” reports has entailed financial transactions or has been sponsored by certain individuals or political parties.</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>Such malpractices have destroyed the credibility of the media itself and are, therefore, detrimental to its own long-term interests. It needs to be noted in this context that so long as journalists (in particular, those who work in non-urban areas) are paid poverty wages or are expected to earn their livelihood by doubling up as advertising agents working on commissions, such malpractices would continue to be rampant.</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>The owners of media companies need to realize that in the long term, such malpractices undermine not just democracy in the country but the credibility of the media as well. Civil society oversight can also deal with the problem, but only to an extent. New rules and guidelines can be introduced and extant ones modified or amended. For instance, there should be a debate among all concerned stakeholders as to whether a directive of the Supreme Court of India that enjoins television channels to stop broadcasting campaign-related information on candidates and political parties 48 hours before polling takes place can and should be extended to the print medium since such a restriction does not apply to this section of the media at present.</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>FOR INSTANCES AND EXAMPLE OF SUCH PHENOMENON, SEE THE REPORT.</p>

<p>As a concerned citizen, I urge all readers of this blog, to boycott such media-groups unless they issue a public apology. Such action not only produce misleading information but also undermine the very democracy which has given them 'freedom of expression' which a few countries outside U.S. and Europe are able to provide to their citizens.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>It has been said that 'behind every great thinker lies a lesser begin who shall translate, collate, annotate or otherwise facilitate his work.' So James Boswell followed Dr.  Johnson around the pubs of London, first 'committing to memory, and thereafter to print, every word uttered in cups'.  Ernest Jones and Strachey assumed the job of biographer and translator respectively of Sigmund Freud.  Being a German, Friedrich Engels took his job rather seriously.  He not only reviewed and subsidised Marx's writing whenever they appeared but also assumed paternity of an illegitimate child to save his friend's marriage.</p>

<p>Gandhi, 'mother of all debate', was fortunate to have adversaries with first rate mind. They came from all corners of the nation and beyond, and with them he often engaged in debates on issues pertaining to India's future.  So with Ambedkar, he argued issues of untouchability and place for Dalits in independent India; with Nehru and other scientists, he debated his preferred economic model (factory or village); With Kamladevi and his adopted British daughter Mira Behn and other remarkable feminists of those days, he discussed women issues and their place in independent India - India gave voting rights to women the day it came into being while the 'pinnacle of democracy' Switzerland did in 1975; with Communists and bhadraloks, he 'disagreed on the efficacy and morality of violence' as political strategy'; with radical Muslims on one hand and with radical Hindus on the others, he fought against the idea of a nation on the lines of religion; and with other giant Rabindranath, he 'disputed the merits of such varied affiliation as the English language, nationalism, and the spinning wheel'.</p>

<p>His debaters were not restricted to the upper-echelon of society. Bhism Sahni, a noted Punjabi and Hindi writer (author of 'Tamas'), wrote a small memoir, 'My Brother Balraj' based on letters Balraj sent his younger brother from Sevagram. Balraj left Savarmati to Sevagram where he could see the great man everyday despite of taste-less food. But more importantly, unlike Savarmati, he could easily smoke his 'sutta' by simply jumping off its wall. He wrote of people coming from far away places and arguing with him: someone was angry with his 'namby-pamby' ahimsa ways while another was furious why Hindi should be made national language while Tamil is even older than Sanskrit. They discussed and argued the way they liked but no one was allowed to monopolise Gandhi for more than 10-20 minutes. If someone was taking too much of his time then Gandhi would look back and send some signal. A 'dark and smelly [sic] Indian would come too close to the persistent debater that he would put off with his smell and leave'. To correspondent who wrote their queries from distant land, he would write back or discuss them in his journal. He sent letters to authorities in Government in his usual style of 'unadorned prose'. During his lifetime, a colossal amount of issues were debated, ideas were erected and refined,  myth and stories were created.</p>

<p>It is a happy accident that men who thus kept 'his conscience' came from all corners of country. Neither of them monopolised his writings. Mahadev Desai, who joined Gandhi first, was his fellow Gujrati 'well placed to accompany him on his village tours, to handle his correspondence, to translate his autobiography and other works of truth.' In 1942, when Mahadev died in prison, he was joined by a 'lean and energetic punjabi Payarelal, secretary to the Mahatma in the last, tormented decade of his life.' When he walked through the riot-torn villages of Eastern Bengal, he was accompanied by 'a Calcutta anthropologists Nirmal Kumar Bose'. In Bose memoirs we often see that his Gandhi was winning over his Marx. These three men met and knew Gandhi in flesh and blood. Their works are read and remembered but it was a man who hardly knew him in person but presented him to the world like no one else. This was a Tamilian and Scholar Krishanaswamy Swaminathan. What follows next are the notes collected on this man of rare energy who edited 'The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi' (CWMG); a neck-to-neck race between editor's age the volume he published which his age won by a narrow margin of 94-90.</p>

<p>Swaminathan was lucky to born in an intellectual family. His father was first to translate Balmiki Ramayan into Tamil, K. Venkataraman, his next-to-him brother was a world authority in synthetic dyes and founder-director of National Chemical Laboratory in Pune, the youngest was K. Sanjivi, 'one of the Madras' best-known teachers and practitioners of medicine', known for his extraordinary and still-vigorous institution, The Voluntary Health Service in Adyar.</p>

<p>Swaminathan was the third editor to be appointed as chief-editor of CWMG. When he took over, only 4 volumes had appeared covering first three comparatively insignificant decade of his life. By the time The Editor retired, 'the story had been brought down to Jan 30, 1948'. His stay in Delhi while editing was not free from troubles. He was not tolerant of British in Indian Educational Service, and Indian Babus and Netas are anyone but humble. He was advised by C. Rajagopalchari himself, before the professor left Madras, to be more tolerant of babus and netas that he had been of his British superiors, 'remember you are serving Gandhi, not the Delhi government.' And so, as Swaminathan was to racall, 'I never yielded to the temptation to resign, and have, like Casablanca, clung to my post for a quarter century while fires raged and storms blew all around me.'</p>

<p>Book writers often speak of 'editorial vandalism' of their writings which transforms the original manuscript into printed matter which author often finds puzzling. The editor feels that pruning, chopping and embellishment is in common interest of readers and the author. Swaninathan was the most reticent of book editor and never tells us what he thought of 'the great thinker' by himself. Although in a lecture given in 1984, in the memory of K. Santhanam, he gave biting but not unfair assessments of other scholar's of Gandhi. Thus Judith Brown 'regards Gandhi as a lover of power using to increase his stature'. Raghavan Iyer 'studies Gandhi in vacuo and try to relate him moral thinkers of the West with little regards to what he learnt from poor people whom he loved and served.' Eric Erikson, 'who wrote a brilliant and wholly satisfying book on "Young Man Luther", analyses Gandhi into shreds and patches, all because he was totally ignorant of Gandhi's cultural background, the living creative poetry of Vishnavism, which none can deny and none can destroy.' On the other hand the editor did comment the thousand-page tome of A. Ramaswamy, a 'meticulous scholar now dead and forgotten because he committed the atrocious sin of writing in Tamil instead of English.' The editor also comments of 'sensation-monger and wizard of box office' - Richard Attenborough. Attenborough's Ben Kingsley disguised as Gandhi is a stuffed dummy set up for floor offerings, which could equally serve, and had actually been used, for target practice by the opponents of non-violence who abound in America, Iran and elsewhere. There is no Rama without Sita, Lakshamana, Bharata, Hanuman, and so on. [But] Attenborough's Gandhi is a Titan among the dwarfs, an eagle among the sparrows, a mere caricature unrelated to the reality.'</p>

<p>These notes have chiefly been taken from essays and memoirs written by Ramachandra Guha, a polymath of our age, to whom Swaminathan was a great-uncle, mama thrice over. In childhood, he touched his sandal clad feet, a gesture more motivated for a ten-rupee note than respect; in boyhood, he discussed Gandhi with him or received post cards carrying gentle admonition: 'Learn Tamil and lead a simple life'; and chastised whenever he wrote something which was not consistent. The 'last civilian' and scholar C. S. Venkatachar once compared The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi to the Qutub Minar, that other monument to industry and efficiency, that marvel like clarity and longevity. But a more suitable analogue was found by his nephew, 'Swaminathan was to Gandhi what Ganapati once was to Vyasa, transcribing and setting into order a narrative of astonishing length and complexity, running out of breath only when his master ran out of words.'</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>How little space is given to poverty, labour and agriculture reporting  in Indian media is no secret. This week EPW edition has published a  study high-lightening percentage of new-items in Hindi-English media  about rural area. This study says that '.. India’s highest circulated  English and Hindi dailies finds that they devote only a minuscule  proportion of their total coverage (about 2%) to rural India’s issues,  crises and anxieties. <strong>Even this low count could be misleading because  most rural news is not about the farmers/villagers or about their  concerns related to land, livestock, resources or farming. </strong>The  content analysis of 968 news items shows that 36% of the coverage goes  to issues of violence, accidents, crime or disasters. Less than 28% is  about agrarian themes while 15% is about hunger, suicides, malnutrition,  distress migration, displacement, or farmers’ movements. The English  newspapers had more coverage of rural distress than the Hindi ones. The  a­uthoritative sources quoted most often in the routine news tend to  belong to the establishment.'</p>

<p>ABOUT EDITORIAL SPACE... On an average, the country’s top  circulation papers devoted about 2% editorial space of their  national/flagship editions with predominantly urban readerships to the  issues and concerns of two-thirds of India.</p>

<p>No newspaper (including Hindu) devotes more than 3.6% of their space to rural story.</p>

<p>THE  QUANTITY OF REPORT... A routine rural story is a brief, single or  double column item on the inside pages and is straight and matter of  fact. Explanations or backgrounders or the likely causes of an incident  are rare. A considerably large number of stories are displayed in the  “briefs” sections which carry just a paragraph or two in a column so  tagged.</p>

<p>SOURCE OF THE REPORT... Most of the prominent and authoritative sources quoted <strong>are often described by media scholars as the “primary definers” of the i­ssues involved</strong>. <strong>These  sources normally have a stake in the issues they try to promote or  block. Much of the routine news coverage is a result of a regular  interaction between media organisation and authoritative source  organisations.</strong> Normally reporters on the beat generate news through  regular and institutionalised i­nteraction with government authorities.  These sources tend to be mainstream politicians and bureaucrats, and  sometimes the civil society activists and other alternative sources.  (Emphasis mine)</p>

<p>AND THE WORST PART... Tables 8 and 9 show that <strong>bureaucrats are not among the preferred sources when it comes to stories about extreme rural poverty or agrarian distress</strong>. However, the government establishment, particularly <strong>politicians are frequently quoted as sources of news in this category</strong>.  A very high proportion of extreme rural poverty theme stories originate  from the reports of academic and other institutions such as the  non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and development agencies. <strong>It is  equally noteworthy that the issues of agrarian distress are the only  area where the peoples’ movements are among the most quoted sources of  news.</strong></p>

<p>AND THE DRUG-PEDDLERS ARGUMENT [3], "<strong>One reason for their lack of  interest could be explained by the fact that their readers, advertisers  and journalists, particularly in the metropolitan editions, come from  urban backgrounds. The dailies tend to be more consumer focused and try  to fulfil the needs and aspirations of educated and upwardly mobile  urban consumers whose universe often has limited space for issues of  poverty and underdevelopment." </strong>[4]<strong> </strong>Now the question arises about the rural-policies formulated by Santa Banta of planning commission sicne <strong>'glaring  omission of rural news in metro editions assumes significance because  of their disproportionate readership among the policy elites and opinion  leaders.' </strong>[2]</p>

<p>On personal level, I have always found it amusing that the Indian  intelligentsia (whether right, left, centre, any -ist, -vian) has  somewhat mixed attitude towards the rural areas. While educated Indians  are inclined to think or at least speak well for the village, they do  not show much inclination for the company of villagers, or for that  matter, anyone who is less-fortunate than them. This is not unusual or  novel in the city-bred individuals. In fact, some of the very best of  them, Rabindra Nath Tagore, M K Gandhi and Nehru had quite romantic  views about villages. These views were mercilessly castigated by  Ambedkar who unlikely others had the first hand experience of Indian  village life [5]. In a set of lectures delivered at Aligarh some 35  years ago, the historian Niharranjan Ray drew attention to urban Indian  perennial nostalgic romance towards Indian villages. This nostalgia, he  observed, "had been expressed since the 19th century in the literary  form in fiction and poety and in political form in the slogan 'back to  the villages'." He further said, "the curious aspect of the whole thing  is that with but few exceptions these writers and poets and these  nationalist leaders were all city dwellers, not villagers themselves,  not were they ever thinking of trekking back to the villages to live  there." [6]</p>

In one of the questions, I would ask them to write something in English about their family, then rewrite the same thing in their mother-tongue or in any other Indian language they knew. Invariably, people who wrote bad English also wrote bad Hindi, bad Marathi, bad Telugu, etc. My belief, therefore, is that poor writing is a result of lack of mental discipline to write properly. Also, it is language-independent. If you’re good in one language, it means you’ve disciplined your mind to write well and carefully. Then you usually imbibe that discipline when writing in another language. Inadequate preparation on the topic may be one aspect, but invariably, lack of discipline and training in writing is the problem.</strong></p></blockquote>

		<div class="entry"><p>In media, especially Western, there has been a lot of talk about gender-discrimination in India. Some report claims that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/15/worst-place-women-afghanistan-india">India is one of the most dangerous place for women to live</a> due to various reasons. These reasons, both prominent and sundry - although visible in almost every sphere of public life - manifest themselves in most cruel ways as female-foeticide and rape.</p>

<p>What do they mean by 'dangerous' is not at all explained. Is it premature death by unnatural causes? Given the life expectancy of Indian females, surely it does not qualify for one of the most dangerous place on the planet. If female foeticide is<br/>
one of the main reason, then why does some of the Western countries do not figure in the list where<a href="http://www.abortionno.org/Resources/fastfacts.html"> abortion rate</a> is as high as 20% - slightly more than half of them surely will be females. And what about on per capita basis? Female foeticide proves that there is an alarming bias against girl child in India but it does not prove that there is an alarming sense of feudalism for women for bias against unborn child is not the same thing as the bias against a living human.</p>

<p>If by 'dangerous', they mean domestic violence then there is an element of truth in the report. There might have been some exaggeration. It is a common habit among journalists to lobby for some cause and they usually believe that its  ok  to stretch the point somewhat if it serves a good cause. This behaviour become more prominent in reports written by social-activists.</p>

<p>Ideally, a student of society is not suppose to talk,  write and think   passionately, for passion is only a thin veil for lack  of argument. But   its hard to remain aloof when you see that something is  wrongly   written and would be perceived distorted.</p>

<p>I,  as a  student of society, can say the work of the journalists are not  very  helpful in analysing a society for journalists do not spend much  time  reading the past of a society and trajectory of its growth. But  the  comments they pass look like a comment on a whole culture and   nation rather than the cause and effect of an issue in a given timeline. This sure is   misleading specially to those who do not have first hand experience of particular culture.</p>

<p>India was perhaps the most hierarchical society (Ref : Homo  Hierarchicus by Louis Dumont) in the past and continue to do so in  present. The discrimination based on gender and caste is still very much real. <a href="http://dilawarsays.blogspot.com/2011/05/modernity-and-indian-society.html">Modernity is still a new phenomenon in India</a> and has not  touched all corners of  it, given the limited reach of communication and literacy among women and men in rural areas. Beside modernity in India is a skewed concept. To many, it means negation of traditions.</p>

<p>The  good thing is that there is empowerment of women though its reach and  pace is rather limited. Nothing could be more revealing than the fact that in the electrical department of IIT Bombay, one of the most modern segment of the society, we have only two female professors -- a ratio much smaller than the ratio of female and male students. It is hard to agree that we did not receive applications from worthy female candidates since at EE - IIT Madras, there are many female professors. What is more distressing that we do not seek out female candidates. If this medieval ratio is present in the community of professors, what would one infer about the normal section?</p>

<p>We do not treat our women like Sweden and Norway but we are not going backwards. After all, 4 chief ministers of India are females. They got support from their male patron in their early political career but they reached to the zenith by themselves. Mayawati and Mamta Banerjee are two extreme cases of female agency in a largely male dominant profession. Given the level hostility against them in media, their achievements rather become more impressive. There are channels, even in the  most traditional part of the society, for women to grow. However these  channels are only available to those who already have a backing from  their families or a patron.</p>

<p>Wars may have been a major factor in degradation of status of women especially in Northern part of  India. When war occurs, women becomes the first victim. In India, since a lot of feudal culture lived together, women mobility was restricted - presumably for their safety. We have seen outsiders as conqueror and warriors. It has stopped  the economic development and also reduced that trust among people. Also  most of the feudal castes and clans, which British used to call martial  races, resides in these areas. These martial races, has been low on  education and modern-ideas. <a href="http://beta.epw.in/newsItem/comment/190130/">They have many medieval customs which are still practiced.</a></p>

<p>The  warrior heroes on these lands in those times were mostly Rajputs (when  Muslim invaded) and Mughals (when British grew in their influence) and  they had the custom to put their women behind the purdah. Though they  were known to treat their women with utmost pride and dignity were their  mobility was restricted and they were not allowed to be educated. Many  other groups took clues from their hero's and started treating their  women in such a ways. My own grandmother is illiterate and my mother  could not continue education after 5th grade since her father was not in favour of it. Now the same village boasts 5 female graduates and arts  and sciences. True, that their education is not world class but one  should be blind to ignore the change in last 50 years.</p>

<p>There still are many who believes that a book called 'Smriti' and 'Shashtras' written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manusm%E1%B9%9Bti">Manu</a>  some 2500 years ago should be considered 'the laws'. These laws have  some of the most derogatory remarks about women and lower castes. The  basic idea was pollution. Since most of the lower caste people assigned  work which was considered 'polluted' such as tanning, farming and  cleaning the roads, their touch was avoided by higher caste Indians for  not to get polluted. Women were considered polluted during their  periods.</p>

<p>A modern day city dwelling  Indian would not even able to understand the idea of pollution. But influence of these laws has left strong habits in their consciousness. One of influence of these laws are non-secular categorisation of work. Indians  still love to grade works they do. Unlike Japanese, we have only respect  of well-born and well to do, and there is no respect for useful work.  Since most of the useful work is polluting in one sense or another. This  scorn for these kind of work is best visible in our restaurant. Indian never say 'thank you' to a waiter or waitress in restaurant.</p>

<p>Going  back in time, In one of the oldest epic, Mahabharta, it seems that  women has much more freedom than most of the modern societies do provide even in these days. Women  Chastity was an elastic concept. A women was free, despite of being  married, to seek sex with some notable warrior or a learned man for a  child. In same ways, it was <em>dharma </em>(duty) for a warrior to accept a  women if she approached him for a son and not for pleasure. Manu was not born only few centuries later than Mahabharta was written. This shows that society sometimes changes rapidly in time-span of few  centuries. At the present juncture, India does not look impressive when  it come to women life. (Ref: Yuganta, Irawati Karve)</p>

<p>To add to  these random facts, one major factor has been the 'mode of production'.  Northern states are wheat producing states while southern states are  rice producing states. In cultivation of rice, everything is done by  hand and the labour of women become much more important. Thus the role of a women is of a co-worker rather than a dependent. When a woman become shareholder in work, she is respected. If a women is not allowed to or can not make a living, what options she have if treated with violence? She has to suffer quietly. Even among villages and towns where women mobility is restricted, adult girls prefer to work if a chance is provided.</p>

<p>An interesting fact, put forward by D D Kosambi, is that in Travencore area plough was invented or discovered very late and agriculture remained in hands of women. Since tilling with plough would have required cattle power and muscle power, it would have transferred control of land from the women to men. Men were mostly in the business of hunting. Where plough was invented early, men got into agriculture for they were in charge of controlling wild animals. With hunting becoming secondary occupation, there is no wonder that men took the control of land from women in these 'advance' society. In Travencore area, such as Kerala, the society is still matriarchal.</p>

<p>Muslim rule in India has also contributed to  degradation of women. But it would be wrong to say that they created  these patterns of mind. They only strengthen those patterns. Manu was  well established before Muslim established themselves here. Most of Indian Muslims were converted and conversion to another religion does not change habits and pattern of mind.</p>

<p>These behaviour of misogamy are  not going to go away easily since people who are moving into middle  class are from small cities and town where traditional misogamy is much more deeply rooted. One can easily hears mockery and derogatory comments about girls in college campuses. Women in our society grows up to be meek, afraid and insecure. Fortunately, many families sure  has moved ahead on roads of female empowerment due to reasons ideological and material. Also, a rising secularism of work, especially in IT and others, have given a segment of women much more monetary power. Time will tell how they are going to use it?</p>

<p>One exception in India is state  of Kerala which despite of having very low per capita income has Human  development Index comparable to first world country. It has a fertility  rate at replacement level, India's lowest birthrate, lowest infant  mortality, highest age of marriage and longest lifespan. Furthermore,  Kerala's literacy rate is over 94%. The major difference between Kerala  and rest of the India that here society is matriarchal.</p>

<p>And for these tendency of ranking, comparing societies generally leads to fruitful outcomes. But to compare for the sake of 'holier than thou' or for ranking purpose is not only simplistic but also irritating.</p>

<p>END NOTES :</p>

<p>[1] See 'Men and Women' - Amartya Sen</p>

<p>[2] NyTimes have been more rational about reporting women in India.</p>

<p>[3]  From the point of view of Social Anthropology, these honor killing does  not imply that women are treated with dignity in these societies. They  give much more protection to their women. But they are not that much  forgivable should a women cross the limits of their custom. These custom  may look ridiculous to outsiders.</p>

<p>[4] The gap in North and South  Indian is really revealing. There is very low chance that a woman will  be manhandles in bus or train in southern city say Chennai than in  northern city like Delhi. In fact, <a href="http://dilawarsays.blogspot.com/2010/08/reflection-on-delhi.html">Delhi looks like a culture-less city  with its reasons in history</a>. After 1857, this city was destroyed by  British (you guys would never escape :-p) to teach a lesson for  uprising. The great families of Shahajahanabad was thrown out and  merchant, traders and like wise people were forced to move in. Since  then, it could not create a identity of its own.</p>

<p>[5] Female foeticide and  domestic violence in India is really very high. And it is not  restricted to some classes or castes. All of India suffer from it. Its  terrible. But these do not restrict women agency all-together.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Civil Society is not a new idea - if we consider that voluntary actions and individual initiative are at heart of it - its presence in India is rather new. Fifty years ago, except for Marxist who drew inspiration of Gramsci rather than Lenin, we did not hear much talk about civil society. These days, civil society has taken the center-stage. People from a very ill defined category of public intellectuals are writing articles on it but it is not at all convincing that they are talking about the same thing. It is far from my intention to belittle the discussions on how effective a civil society can be towards making individual and collective life more fruitful, but when people do not have a clear idea of civil society and its composition, it will be a mistake to believe that one can reach very far in understanding their capabilities and their roles.</p>

<p>In earlier days, public intellectuals were fond of the state which they thought was undoubtedly a powerful and secular force in a largely undemocratic and backward society and if applied effectively and boldly, would change it. <a href="http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?270136">Today the state has lost its sheen.</a> Part of reason to this disenchantment lay in the high expectation from the state and belief in its trans-formative powers. Its actual performance was indifferent, and Emergency and aftermath showed that it could be oppressive and ineffectual. The multiple scams of unimaginable magnitude has only strengthened these feelings. Among the youths, these feelings have taken rebellious colors. They seem to be much more interested in getting 'things' done even if it takes bypassing and weakening the democratic institutes. These indifferent attacks on the foundation of democracy are expected from a society which has been and still a largely hierarchical society.</p>

<p>The romance with civil society is not because of itself. It is an outcome of growing mistrust in political parties, the legislature, snail paced judiciaries and bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Individual initiatives and voluntary actions are vital for a democracy to grow. If by civil societies are able to provide platform to these activities then their importance can not be over emphasized. One can blame state for dampening the spirit of entrepreneurship and voluntary action in early decades of independence but it only reinforced and did not create these habits of mind already present in a caste- and kin-based hierarchical society.</p>

<p>Alexis de Tocqueville was the first political theorist who dwell on significance and importance of voluntary- action and associations for a democracy. Let me quote his often quoted words,</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Sixty years after the the independence, two phenomena are ubiquitous these days. One is the manner in which <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/article927895.ece">public anxiety</a> shows itself over many problems with which our public institutes are beset - misuse of funds, lack of discipline, absenteeism, work stoppage, strikes and so on - <strong>all of which are in some way related with failure of some regulatory rules</strong>. Second, the growth of civil societies which seems to be outcome of government failure on social front, like markets which were the outcome of government failures on economic front.</p>

<p>From the behemoth state to the smallest government Institute, there is an addiction to 'create rules of every kind and to the last detail'. After these rules are created to the last details, they are discarded. And then there is a demand for new one. These 'activity of creating a rule and discarding the same' is not a malfunction of government but it is rather a Indian culture of dealing with rules. There are many people who are aware of this and disturbed by it but they can do little about it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irawati_Karve">Irawati Karve</a> has given this rule about Indian society and it seems to be always operative, '<strong>The addition of new rules does not lead to the elimination of old ones; they are simply put into cold storage, to be taken out when required to trip up any unwary newcomer who tries to inject some dynamism into the system.' </strong></p>

<p>Our orientation towards rules seem to be indigenously our own. We differ totally in our orientation from other cultures. There is an ambiguity in our rules. Many perceive them the way they like because multiple convenient interpretations are allowed. It can lead to a severe breakdown of system. It was all visible in A. Raja's acts dealing with telecom policy in 2G scam. He was not only able to use the part of the rules and interpret them as he wished but also he was able to do it quite easily.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankim_Chandra_Chattopadhyay">Bankimchandra</a>, a nineteenth century writer was troubled by tendencies of some of his contemporaries to quote prescriptions from the shashtras to support one or another reform they wish to promote. He found these rules to be prolix. He wrote, '<em>Indeed, it is not possible in any society to be fully regulated by all the prescriptions to be found in the shashtras of Manu and the others. It is doubtful if ever, at any time, those prescription were fully operative in any society. Many of them are inoperable, involve such hardship to men that they would drop out on their own. Many are mutually contradictory. If any society is ever destined to keep all the prescriptions in operations, such a society has indeed an evil destiny.' (Quoted in [1]) </em>Those who get frustrated by the maze of rules in offices can find some solace in Bankim reflection on past.</p>

<p>Now how people used to get their work done in the face of this plethora of inconsistent, obsolete and unclear rules? According to Andre Beteille, '_They improvise, activate personal networks and go about their business without paying too much attention to the rules. This probably is how they worked system in the past, and this is how they try to work it today.' __ _</p>

<p>These days societies are not only much bigger to live face-to-face but also organized in very different ways. When they come into contact with other societies for trade or business; they expect to honor the agreement by some law or rule. Even in our business class, which suppose to understand the value of a consistent system and trust, is notorious is flouting rules and breaking trust if the party at receiving end is powerless such as farmers and workers etc.. I am not sure how taking the streets with the demand of new rules will be effective without a radical change of the orientation towards the regulatory rules of society?<br/>

		<div class="entry"><p>There will not be any civilization worth the name if it does not grant certain amount of privacy to its members. But different civilizations put different premium on it.  Privacy does not fascinate Indians much. Most of us will see it with indifference. I am not aware of a large amount of work done on 'privacy' by our sociologists. We lack a sound theory on it. Our understanding and appreciation of privacy is very low. However, some changes can be seen occurring in favor of privacy. Most of these changes are an outcome of 'globalization' and industrialization which are rather new phenomenon. Globalization and industrialization are forcing Indians to deal with other cultures where people put a high premium on privacy. Recently, a comparative study was done by CMU on how Americans and Indians perceive privacy [2].</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>We intend to differentiate males and females. In fact, we are going to make them complementary to each other. Surely, this is an oversimplification for both of them exhibit certain behaviors common to each other. This is more or less an Utopian view of human race. This is not to say that 'if men are from planet X then women are from planet Y.' We only say that both are from the same planet but given an option would chose different directions.</p>

<p>Humans are not complete without emotions. In fact, these emotions make them impossible to define in plain and simple terms. Here, we categorize emotions into two sets. When an action of a single human effects an individual emotional state and creates an emotion, we say it is an 'individual induced emotion' (<strong>IIE</strong>) e.g. jealousy or envy after seeing someone's car, hate and love for an individual, anger towards an individual because he/she has done or said something etc. When an emotion is a byproduct of an action of a large group, we call it 'group induced emotion' (<strong>GIE) </strong>e.g. Hate for Muslims after 9/11, caste based discrimination in India, hate for alien cultures, envy for some nation's wealth, respect for a brave race etc.</p>

<p>Similarly, we also classify actions. Any individual action which causes IIE (or a GIE is a very small group) is classified as 'individual oriented actions' (<strong>IOA) </strong>e.g. showing off wealth in neighborhood, shopping useless but fancy products, public display of affection etc.<strong> </strong>If an action by an individual is done to influence or create <strong>GIE </strong>is called 'group oriented actions' e.g. actions of politicians, saints, intellectuals, scientists etc.</p>

<p>We are confused where to put humor. We consider it as 'zero' element of our emotions. It is present in both GIE and IIE. The purpose of 'humor' is also not well defined. We can not say why individual uses humor while making an argument and why people who are humorous can say many things which they would not dare say in plain terms.</p>

<p>Lemma 1 :<strong> A human male is like a capacitor. </strong></p>

<p>Capacitors are usually not coupled. Charging and discharging of one capacitor does not affect the charge on other capacitor (unless they are coupled). This is to say that a male in a group is not at all interested in others IIE. He is mostly interested in GIE for his or his group benefits. A group of men can live together without causing IIE. This is an oversimplification.</p>

<p>Lemma 2 : <strong>A female is like a inductor.</strong></p>

<p>****Inductors have this property of 'mutual and self inductance'. They are mostly coupled to each other. Any instant of charging or discharging of an inductor changes the state of other inductors. This is to say, in a group of females, any action of one female emotionally influences females in group. They causes IIE. This is to say, they mostly talk about personal stuff in for the sole purpose of enhancing or reducing IIE's of the member of groups. This is also an simplification.</p>

<p>NOTE:  Group induced emotions such as motivation, inspiration, patriotism (love for fellow citizens), nationalism (hate for foreigners), enlightenment, humor are caused by GOA. GOA changes 'intellectual emotions' (if I can say it that way) while IOA targets IIE ('personal emotions'). We are not saying that female only communicate in a way which only causes individual effects. We meant to emphasis on the fact that one can clearly see the females have inclination for this kind of behavior.</p>

<p>Lemma 3 : <strong>A relationship is 'oscillation' in a circuit formed by L and C (we are not considering R right now). Strength of a relationship is the frequency of oscillation. </strong><br/>
<strong><br/>
</strong><br/>
Theorem 1 :<strong> A capacitor (inductor) can be converted into a inductor (capacitor) by using a gyrator.</strong></p>

<p>Proof can be located on internet easily. This is to say, with some extra circuitry called gyrator we can make a capacitor behave like an inductor and vice versa. Equivalently, a male can behave like an female and vice versa, with the help of some 'means' (gyrator). To keep this blog short, we leave this undefined.</p>

<p>Definition : <strong>A lasting 'relationship b/w male and female' is like sustainable oscillation in a capacitor-inductor circuit without consuming any power.</strong><br/>
<strong><br/>
</strong><br/>
Well, to  understand this one has to take basic course in 'Network theory'. We assume that you have taken it. Now, we restate the common wisdom in our language.</p>

I am not claiming that I can be 'fair' to everyone. No one is supposed to make decisions which are acceptable to all but it is no excuse of making incompetent judgments.

		<div class="entry"><p>Enjoying fame and keeping an independent mind is not something one can expect from anyone. Fame is a double-edge sword. one feel tempted to do whatever one's admirers want, and admirers are possessed with the one being admired. It creates a loop with 'positive feedback'; and 'positive feedback' is known do nasty thing to a system, especially to its stability. It is far from my intention to build a 'system theory' for these kind of social behavior. One probably will not go very far in this direction for humans do not behave like mechanical 'components'. Nonetheless, even though individuals are hard to predict, a collection of individuals acting together under the influence of other humans (i.e. group) are relatively easy to predict. So as a group grows, it becomes more and more 'predictable'. One can use 'system theory' ideas to study social groups.</p>

<p>Positive feedback can have severe effect on 'individuals' also. On my mind, I have three examples. First is Salman Rushdie. It really hard to believe he is the same guy who once wrote 'Midnights children'; Arundhati Roy is second. Had she not become famous and then attached with the social-movements, we'd still have a remarkable fiction writer; third and more recent is A. R. Rahman, I find it troubling that he has become capable of producing the kind of 'stuff' for which he is being awarded 'this and that'. Compare with him with that 'Roja' guy.</p>

<p>One can have one priorities to act under the wishes of a certain group. In fact, most of Indian chose their careers which are appreciated and encouraged in their social circle. Gone are the days when parental pressure used to make students choose their career though there are movies made in this era which still love to point fingers at parents. Since the consumer of this movie were suppose to be same students, it could not tell them you are responsible for what you do. Its remarkable how a movie titled 'three idiots' with so many double standards could become so famous<a href="http://www.eledu.net/rrcusrn_data/India,%20Higher%20Education%20and%20Bollywood.pdf">[2]</a>. So if a lot of IIT graduate vie for banking job, its not because they know that they want to do it, but it makes a nice story to tell their friends, family etc.. Brands, whether of clothes or of companies, works in the same way. When there is a high brand value<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/dec/21/christmas-gift-aditya-chakrabortty">, there is a nice story to share</a>. I have seen people who just love to climb the mountains, prefer using lifts to go to second floor of their hostels. Climbing stairs do not create a 'story' to share in a group.</p>

<p>If Rehman wants to please 'white ears' so let it be. Most of the colonized minds of 'Browns' will like him anyway. Fall of an individual is not as severe as fall of Institutes. A fame which came from incompatible sources can ruin one. Among Institutes, IIT/IIM's are famous for the reasons generally incompatible with what a university should be known for. What this kind of fame can do to Institutes such as IIT (I am not at all interested in IIMs, they have bigger problems to solve!)?</p>

<p>It is unsettling to note that how easily a semi-literate union minister can lecture IIT (or any Indian university) on what they should do as an university. Or a dim-wit newspaper like <em>Times of India</em> love to give tutorials on how to run a university - mostly written by a five-point-someone. It is more unsettling to note that no one from these institutes can tell them fairly and squarely that its not his expertise to tell universities how should they develop themselves or what should they do. True, that telling truth to a typical Indian who also wield some power can have severe effect on  individual but I don't think we lack bold people very much. So why politicians and media (which is worse) can get away with it?</p>

<p>Since almost all of the universities are funded by government, one can not be free from their influence. In fact this reason was enough for Kapil Sibal to justify his incompetency on the matter. IIT's on the other hand, though do few things to bring changes by themselves, feel quite irritated about it. <a href="http://www.iitbombay.org/news/Current/iit-faculty-strike-over-pay-and-autonomy">They seek, as expected, to get financial autonomy, mostly by increasing the fees</a>. So that they do not have to listen to government. IIM has already done so and converted themselves into the schools for elites where no poor person, no matter how talented, can dare to seek an admission. Even if one does, with easy loans, he has to play into the hands of industries/corporates to pay back. The guy is dead anyway. Love of the FICCI and others towards IIMs can be understood. They know very well  that everyone graduating from these institutes now will have to privatize this intellect and soul to them -- there is no option available to go to the rural hinder-land to serve. Raising fees, without any concern for per capita Indian income, is really obscene. They should know the students from villages also come to these institutes though there are trying very hard to keep them at bay by introducing online exams. How they are to compete on computer when they are used to pen and paper?</p>

<p>Money seems to be of secondary importance these days. What is puzzling for us that IIT's are reputed for the reasons they really wish to avoid these days, namely, talking about pay packages of their students. <strong>In fact, sometimes one wonders whether they do have anything else to talk about to justify their 'bright mind'. </strong>Though this helps newspapers like Times of India to attract some eyeballs; we get a guilty conscience. Nothing can be more crass to be known as a Institute whose students can only prove their worth in terms or Rupees they are able to fetch from the any sort of jobs for which they were not trained using public resources. In fact, this point have been used against us again and again. To make matter worse, media has been silent of our 'other whiz kids' like Narendra Karmarkar, Debapratim Goswami, Madhu Sudan, Manindra Agarwal, J Vasi, Deepak Pathak, H Narayana, Narayan Murthy etc. And contrary to popular belief, you can not count these kind of genius on fingers. Nonetheless, you can surely use your finger to count how many of them are in India.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>In this blog, we explore primitive mathematical properties of of <strong>love</strong>. Here we are only concerned with love between male and females. Among other things, we shall show that concept of '<strong>love triangle</strong>' is a myth unless one allows homosexuality.MATHEMATICAL PRELIMINARIESLet $latex \mathbb{H}$ be the set of all humans. Let $latex \mathbb{M} \subset \mathbb{H}$ is the set of all <strong>lovable Males</strong> (definition?) and let  $latex \mathbb{F} \subset \mathbb{H}$ be the set of all <strong>lovable </strong><strong>females </strong>. It follows that  $latex \mathbb{M} \cup \mathbb{F} \subset \mathbb{H}$. <strong>Sexual love</strong>, is a binary relation. Nothing more is known for sure. Sexual love is mostly depicted in movies and romantic fiction etc. Lets denote it by $latex \heartsuit$. $latex A \heartsuit B$ says that 'sexual love' exists between $latex A$ and $latex B$. A <strong>love triangle</strong> is a construction which has three <strong>vertices</strong> and 'sexual love' exists between any of its two node. If we draw vertices as a dot and 'sexual love' between two vertices as a line, it will closely resemble the triable which we all are familiar with since school days. $latex A \heartsuit B$ implies that $latex A$ and $latex B$ belongs to different gender i.e. if $latex A \in \mathbb{M}$ then $latex B \in \mathbb{F}$ etc. In plain English, <strong>homosexuality</strong> is not allowed. If love is non-sexual e.g. love between mother and her child, between math and mathematician, we'll denote it by $\clubsuit$ but we are NOT going to talk about it in this blog since it is written on Valentine day.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>The trouble with spending time on a 'good university' (or having educated parents) is that it might make you incapable of thinking about certain ideas. If you are a historian trained in Harvard University, than like New York Times, you may not be able to think beyond the nations of Atlantis. An economist, who have spend a fair amount of his/her time in 'Chicago-Stockholm Express' can not digest the criticism of 'free-market'. A typical students of Jawaharlal National University find it hard to listen to what neoliberals has to say. Indian journalists trained in Western privy league universities can not believe that poor do exists in India e.g. according to Times of India, we are living in a golden age. A typical engineer or scientist can not believe that there could be some soocial problems which can not solved by implementing some sort of technology. Fortunately, on the campus of IITB (or on any campuses which takes pride in producing 'Whiz Kids' rather than Bose of Raman) we do not have these kind of problems. Actually no one can accuse us of having any radical idea. Outside India, engineers have shown tremendous diversity of thoughts. From Ludwig Wittgenstein to Osama Bin Laden, we have touched upon many facets of ideas. Indeed, seeking a career in tangentially related fields have now become a norm rather than an exception on most of the engineering campuses in India. I have more to say about it, see [Appendix]</p>

<p>It not just universities which can blind us. We loose many faculties as we move ahead in our school education system. Here, I am going to reflect on logarithms (in fact, going to lobby for them) and their superiority over linear scales generally used in academia. In passing we'll touch upon many seeming unrelated ideas. Our central argument is going to be based on evolution. And social construct which might have played their roles building up our predilection for a liner scale at the cost of logarithms.</p>

<p>Necessity is NOT a mother of all inventions? Though necessity is mother of most of the inventions in Industrial age. Most of the early inventions might have been done out of curiosity only. Their necessity only became apparent later e.g. cooking food on fire was not a necessity, some chap might have got curious about it. But invention of scales might have been a necessity. Comparison is what we do when we start seeing. To compare we need a scale. Early humans might have liked to compare few things for sure. Size of their potential hunt and meat it can provide them. Size of their social group and of adversaries etc. Comparing is an old habit. Nothing has changed in this regard. In modern times, on schools or on any universities, we are always compared. Although the methods are changed. First we were compared whether we are born in a certain class or caste, now we are compared, along with these primitive social construct, how well we perform in certain competitions and how much we earn. Linear scales are mostly employed. Lets consider something we are all concerned about, marks! On a linear scale, anyone who scored 70 in one test and 100 in the next has a growth of 30; another who improved from 20 to 50 also has a growth of 30. Should both progress be termed as 'same'? On a linear scale, yes! Perhaps the the range of the marks is not quite large in which we can produce a visible contrast. Besides linear scales become more relevant when we compare seemingly 'same' entities. A class can be compared on a linear scale but a high-school student and a graduate student surely can not. How about when we have to compare different entities? I can run half a kilometer and and take Mr. X who can run 10 kilometer in one stretch. If somehow I am able to run 4 kilometer; will my willpower is 'same' as Mr. X should he run 14 kilometers. If yes, then this is unfair! My improvement by a factor of '4' make Mr. X run 10x4 = 40 kilometer to claim the same level of 'willpower'. What about frequency response of two amplifiers? Would you measure it in linear scale and then compare? Or pH of two solutions, magnitude of two earthquakes, level of two sounds. Then question arises which scale is more natural. Linear of Logarithm?</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Draft.</p>

<p>If you are born in an Indian village - at least the one in which I was born - you can be sure of two things; one,  you will not know your date of birth (according to global calender even though it is mostly used) and second, you will never be known by your given name. These two social construct of 'puranic' proportion can only be belied should you survive the basic schooling and somehow jump into the bandwagon named education. Education makes you to realize that if you are born in this 'den of ignorance', knowledge and ignorance, both are bliss.</p>

<p>In my village, which consists of only Hindus of 5 castes, one family started celebrating birthday of one of their kids in 1990's. Few others followed the suit in last decade. This first family to celebrate b'day was a prominent joint family and the 'lucky' kid was the youngest one in family. This family used to have hold over whole village, and over nearby villages, for at-least a century. And may be to prove their superiority, they chose to do this foreign thing. This family was also the the first one to own a T.V.. And it is very likely that they got the idea of celebrating b'day from 'idiot box'.</p>

<p>Every village has its own character and it will be a travesty of 'theory' to generalize any concept about village. Though one can surely typify some of the characteristics. Only a damn fool (from city) and and a bloody ignorant (again from city) would be able to convince himself that villages have something in common for sure. Villagers do not worry about themselves or about the world. Indeed, poor people do not worry about anything, they seem to know how this world function! Well, there are few things which you could be almost sure of, that poor people in India have astonishing will to survive with dignity and they take life in better terms. Neither they worry about 'whither my life?' nor 'death' scares them as it does their Western counterparts. Talking of West, Indian countrymen takes life in much better ways than they do. One can then get the idea by only listening to the Western country songs. They are overfilled with grief and sadness, Indians one are full of joy and happiness (I am not denying that real life these days may be quite opposite). Besides, it is considered manly if one can laugh at the idea of death. May be it is due to our 'believes' that the soul changes its clothes and have reincarnated somewhere else at the same moment. May be the hidden joy of of 'new birth' cancel out the 'hidden sadness' of a 'death'.</p>

<p>Fortunately this village have not witnesses that much of violence as some of the other villages have witnessed and are witnessing or have taken part in it. Its was late 70's when a old man and old woman died during a fight - as people say due to a stray bullet and not by intention. Since then it has only seen minor incident till 2000. Last decade was the most peaceful one.</p>

<p>Lets come back to our topic. Date of birth is not an issue which can be of an epic proportion in villages. If you get to school, you always get one. Except for that piece of paper, no one remembers it. But 'names' is an issue which can really create stories.</p>

<p>Before I began dwelling into my memories, I wish to comment over a 'ridiculous burden' forced over us. When 'aryan' came to settle in north India, for first 3000 year they did not write down a damn thing, then they composed their first 'veda'. Now to disseminate knowledge or whatever, they used their tongue and spoke. They must have loved to talk a lot. This is still true. Indians, in per capita basis, are the worst writers, both in quantity and quality. However, they are formidable speaker. Others, especially Japaneses, mistake this verboseness and eloquence for intelligence. Although they mostly speak 1000 words where only 10 will do, they have been quite thrifty when it came to giving names. Most of our 'puranic' and 'vedic' character posses single name e.g. Ram, Lakshman, Arjun, Krishna etc.. I am not sure how big the names were in early 'Tamil' anthologies. Even in these days, in villages, names are still short. We are not talking about south Indians and 'Daruwalla' and 'Malpani' kind of professional names. Then came British and they must have tried to continue with their culture of having at least two names. Poeple who wanted to get jobs had to fall in line. Some, especially from Western coastal areas, took their village names as their last name like Palwankar. In north, in my area, we have to contend ourselves with 'singh' and 'kumar'. While former is a influenced by 'Sikh', the latter is simply an assertion of 'bachelorhood', though these days 'Kumar' is used even after marriages. Woman were tagged with 'devi' if married and with 'kumari' otherwise. Our business class like Agarwals, Saxena, Bhatnagar etc and 'educated' class especially 'Bhadralok Bengalis' took to this system of 'binary names' quite passionately. For them, it helped in business as well as in education. One could simply figure out whether they belong to a certain class/caste. In our case our history and culture act as a 'slow-down' factor. Rajputs and Brahmins were marked out in public by their attire and not by their names. A sword in his side and a thread over a top-less body served this purpose. In these times, having any of these two objects on your body can either make you a laughing stock or land you in jail. Brahmins, by their very nature, always kept and keen eyes over future power-equations and adapt themselves to it. We, with all the 'self-respect' and 'traditions' on our head, took to agriculture which was the only respected occupation for a military man. Despite of having total private control over lands, we could not convert it into a 'business' and still continue to do so. Now a 'Me' given a name like mine, confuses others by a combination of first name which is Muslim and a last name which is Sikh. On top of it, I sound like a Jat and claim to be a rajput.</p>

<p>Back in my village, among old people, I am not known by my name. If the old person is a lady, she will say, 'Savitri ka launda Bumbai wala' or 'Savitri ka launda jo vegyanik hai' or 'savitri ka launda beech wala' or 'Gullad wali ka pota - (grandson of Gulad wali)'; If its an old man, then my name will be, 'mumbai wala engineer', or 'seth ji ka beech wala launda'; if he is of my father age then again the previous names holds. If they are of my age then only I will be known by my name. Enough of self-absorption, lets hunt for others.</p>

<p>Lets start with old man. There is no one who is remembered by their original names. Depending on the most impressive deeds they have done in their lives, they will be named. If this particular old man is a schoolteacher, he will be known as 'master ji'. If there are more than one 'master ji' then an adjective is in order. This adjective is generally name of the 'mohalla'. If an old man is missing some body part then he will known accordingly. Like if a hand is missing then its 'tunta budhdha', if he legs are not working then 'tik tiki wala budhdha'. If this old man is kind towards children then he will be named in slightly better terms. If he is not then a more demeaning word will be found from local vocabulary which there is of no use putting here. Anyway some samples - 'mahoo', 'dabri', 'galgal', 'gandheliya', 'bakkal', 'kanchu', 'bankada' etc. There is no meaning of these words. Emphasis is put on how ridiculous these name sounds rather than how funny they mean. Actually this whole business of constructing new names is an extension of our linguistic tradition which put a lot of emphasis on minute phonological changes rather than nuances of meaning which is a hallmark of English.</p>

<p>Naming old woman are not a tough task. As far as children are concerned, they will simple say 'X ki dadi' (grandmother of X) where X being one of them. Other woman will name her either 'X is dadi' of 'Y is ma'. Fellow old woman are the only one who MAY call her by her name. That is only possible when they are alone. It is not to say that they are not named according to their habits or looks but this way of naming them is not the most significant. There are few who are named as 'chasme wali budiya' (old woman with spectacles), or 'hasmukh budhiya' (old woman with a smile). Generosity of words is not denied in naming them in these ways.</p>

<p>Most of the villages in my area must have a 'Gandhi' and a 'Hitler' at any given day. Well, a Gandhi and a Hitler resides in every Indian struggling for his supremacy. The only difference here is that they live together in harmony. Though they will not leave a chance to mock each other. While crossing each other ways, they will exchange few words. Gandhi, as expected, will not go beyond 'Salle Hitler', Hitler will not leave a opportunity to use his favorite words of 'Abe bhootni ke Gandhi, teri maa ki....etc stc '. The 'Gandhi' is always the one who is 'most peaceful', calm with himself and 'like a cow' for his family. Anyone should be able to fool him. The 'Hitler' on the other hand, should be the one who has done some remarkable deeds of disapproving nature. Like our current Hitler, who is aged 19, has failed high-school 5 times. Well this is not a record. There is one who has failed is six times. He is named 'chhanga' - for his six fingers in one hand. But he stands apart, in both magnitude and significance of his failure. He has scored a 0 in Hindi, his mother tongue and passed but English in same year. Even in village, you don't see this kind of performance. Besides he thinks that the enzyme in Human saliva is name 'Homo sapiens'. To be honest, it is the only technical word he knows.</p>

<p>Getting the tile of Hitler is not at all easy. He posses some other characteristics also. One he never listens to his elders, fights with them and run away abusing them. Now these are some fundamental characteristics expected from every rural kid but in my village, which is more  'civilized' than others nearby villages, this much is enough to grant him this appellation.  Our Hitler is nothing compared to the 'Hitler' of nearby village. Our lacks feudal nature, their lacks a sense of humor.</p>

<p>Having a Ravan is a village is optional. Our Ravan (or Ravania) got this name because of his childhood fantasy to act 'Ravan' in village 'Ramayan'. Since he was a child, he could not perform as a full grown Ravan. So he decided that he must make his own theater. He, his brothers, and some of his friends decided to play Ramayan. He declared himself Ravan and went to the roof of his house, a cottage. From there, he ordered that he must be killed by Ram now. Ram (being acted by his younger brother) started shooting arrows. Suddenly he remembered that Ravana should be killed by agni baan (the firing arrow). So he ordered that He must be fired upon by Ram an agni baan. They prepared an agni baan and shot him while he was making Ravan like evil laugh. The arrow missed him for Ram was not a good shooter and landed on the cottage (chappar) and caught fire. Ram and co. ran away leaving Ravana behind (that make sense since there was no danger of loosing Sita in their act). Somehow Ravan jumped from the roof escaped and ran away to escape the wrath of his father Moolchand (popularly known as Mooli (the Radishfinger)). There was trouble afterward.</p>

<p>After some year, he again got whimsical to act like Ravan. This time he thought that he shouldn't play with fire and decided to act some other part of Ramayan in a quiet place where there could be nothing to burn - even if he wish to. His father, the radishfinger Mooli, was in a mood to go to market and had to leave his musk-melon field at the mercy of his sons - he had no other option. He ordered them to take care of the field till he returns. This was the awesome opportunity to do their grand act. When the old guy went to the town 'Seohara', He and his theater team decided that they will perform it in the field. He agreed. He took his mother's sari with him since they were planning to bring Sita into their play - to give it more charms. The team had a significant number of actors since they were going to a tasty musk-melon field. There, the team decided that there must be some 'pet pooja' before they start any acting. An agreement was reached in record time. There was disaster in the field of musk-melon. Some they eat, mostly wasted. If one melon was not tasty they dump it in the ground so that Mooli can  not find it. After an hour of ruthless killing of musk-melons they were all set to act.</p>

<p>Things were getting fine and Sita was successfully kidapped by the Ravan. But then Mooli came back. He saw and wonder,"What the hell this lady is doing on my farm? And why so many kids and one lady?" A lone lady could have been a pleasant surprise but a lady with so many kids were of no use to him. He started cursing from distance. When the team realised who is coming back, they vanished! Sita, was a very fast runner. Our small guy, our Ravan, could not run that fast and captured by his father and was beaten badly. He was a tiny kid. He can not be named Ravan. For being Ravan, one must be big enough. So he became Ravaniya - a childish Ravan. Since then he is known as Ravaniya.</p>

<p>Some names are given just opposite to what they do or look like. Like our pahalwan weigh 50 K.g. while Sukhkhe is over 100.</p>

<p>Not every village have the same standards of naming. Another Ravan in another village is named Ravan because he does odd things like carrying a bundle of load on his cycle upside down tied with a bamboo-pole rather than keeping it flat. While being a Bakeel in my village means someone who talk a lot like a lawyer, Bekeel in some other village could be the one who is deaf and mute. Our master-ji must be an schoolteacher, others masterji may be the one whose seven generation haven't seen the backyard of a school. Most oddly, while our 'Gunda' is the most polite person in the village, theirs is a really a 'Gunda'. Villages are factory where names are produced as well as a graveyard where they are buried.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Aman [Brigadier Amanullah, secretary to Benazir Bhutto and former chief of Pakistan’s military intelligence in Sind, bordering India] noticed me looking at the painting and followed my gaze. …</p>

<p>“A rocket ship heading to the moon?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “A nuclear warhead heading to India.”</p>

<p>I thought he was making a joke. … I told Aman that I was disturbed by the ease with which Pakistanis talk of nuclear war with India.</p>

<p>Aman shook his head. “No,” he said matter-of-factly. “This should happen. We should use the bomb.”</p>

<p>“For what purpose?”</p>

<p>He didn’t seem to understand my question.</p>

<p>“In retaliation?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Or first strike?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>I looked for a sign of irony. None was visible…</p>

<p>“We should fire at them and take out a few of their cities — Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta,” he said. “They should fire back and take Karachi and Lahore. Kill off a hundred or two hundred million people… and it would all be over. They have acted so badly toward us; they have been so mean. We should teach them a lesson. It would teach all of us a lesson. There is no future here, and we need to start over. So many people think this. Have you been to the villages of Pakistan, the interior? There is nothing but dire poverty and pain. The children have no education; there is nothing to look forward to. Go into the villages, see the poverty. There is no drinking water. Small children without shoes walk miles for a drink of water. I go to the villages and I want to cry. My children have no future. None of the children of Pakistan have a future. We are surrounded by nothing but war and suffering…”[1]</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering is designed to test your  basics in engineering. It has nothing to do with experiences in industries. By engineering basics, I mean your core courses. You must know them. I  was bit troubled with all these mushrooming of GATE coaching centres on the line of JEE and  the way they 'buy' opinion to suit their business, so I am  writing this.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure that one can succeed in exams without using these centre. There is hardly any  need of them unless you really can't do anything without spoon feeding. But they create an atmosphere where one can build a momentum to study - if one is occupied with 'inertia'. Nonetheless, attending coaching classes is always better than doing nothing. Anyway  spend your time wisely. If you really have time to spare, read quality books.</p>

<p>It does not matter if problems asked in GATE are hard or easy. Competition is tough, and it is getting tougher with the rise in numbers of applications every year.  Success in such competitions increases one's confidence. But one should not take it as a benchmark of one's capabilities - after  all its an exam and that too of A, B, C, D type. If one bad day in you exam should not  make you loose your confidence then one ultra-good day must not make you  take undue pride in your capabilities. Though the chances of possessed  by later is much higher than the former. In case of failure, there are  many factors one can blame. But success is always believed to be due to 'me and myself only'.</p>

<p>However, I  must admit that 'success' is very necessary evil in one form or other.  It boosts one confidence - should one is unfortunate to have little or  moderate amount of it. But this 'confidence' evaporates easily if stop putting lesser effort in her later ventures. Even on these lines, GATE is  not the only thing to strive for. From improving your father's business  to solving century old problems, there are many options available.  Undue 'pride' and 'vanity' generally ruins people in long run, so does  a low self-esteem. If you are convinced that you can not excel in GATE then there is no point writing this exam. If you let failure hitting you, you will start thinking negatively about yourself. There is no point reducing your self confident.</p>

<p>One really does not have to go to any coaching center or to subscribe to  their costly preparatory materials. Get previous examination papers and  solve them. Start early (say late December) and solve one or two  problems from each section every day. But one must solve them completely. No cheating. If a  problem takes 7 days, give it to that monster. If you are not solving  tough problems, you are just bullshitting. Why would you solve a problem  which is easy. This means you already know it. Solving easy problem is  cheating. Do not do that. Save them for exams! Keep  problem solving going on till neural path in your brain align themselves to suit  GATE.</p>

<p>No one is suppose to read everything. If you have attended only few classes  in your course work and teacher was worse than the worst which is usually true in 2nd tier institutes then you must give your course book an easy reading. Just to make  sure you know where '<em>this and that</em>' concept is. Use books as reference material and not as a story book. 'Reading book' is your  girlfriend, 'solving problem' is your wife. You are allowed to spend  time with both. Divide your time carefully that meets need of your life.  But don't do that in real life. Actually you can! See, here problems  reside in book, by that logic, your wife must reside in your girlfriend. Then there is no problem.</p>

<p>So bottom-line is that after watching latest animated movie, buy previous  years papers and solve them. When I say 'solve it'; I really mean solve  it. No matter how simple a problem look like. Convince yourself that you  understood it. It'd be a good idea if you masturbate before you start  solving, so that chances of distraction will be minimum. Stay away from  Internet, even if you have some e-affair going on. Or at least try to  refrain. Of course, there is time and place for everything.</p>

<p>Everyone is smart enough to understand that '<strong>in the end, what you think and what you  feel is of little value</strong>'. Your feeling and thoughts should shape your work; that what ultimately counts. Don't run into nihilism that there is no point in anything. What you do or have done,  ultimately, will be insignificant but it is very important that you do  it. Not only because it is useful but also If you do not occupy yourself with something productive then you'll  have the luxury of time to think over whether you are happy or sad. And this is  exactly when life starts getting boring and miserable. I have added few  arguments on top of what Shaw and Gandhi have argued.</p>

<p>And by the way, I know what I am talking about. Trust me!</p>

<p>PS : If ignorance is bliss then why so many people are not happy. -- Thomas Jefferson.</p>

<p>As usual. All the best.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Russian President Dimitry Medvedev visited IIT Bombay on Dec 22, 2010 (Thanks to Mr. Anonymous for correcting the date). Russian contribution in establishing IIT Bombay was tremendous. You can measure their contribution by noting that on our website '<a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/about/how.html">history of IIT Bombay</a>' page acknowledges it in six lines out of total ten lines written about IIT-B history. 60% by line numbers and since these 6 lines are longer, their contribution become larger if one take 'words' written about it as a unit.</p>

<p>In January 15, 1959, a ship named after one of the most deadliest battle-cruiser of her time "Admiral Ushakov" arrived in Bombay with first consignment of instruments for IIT Bombay. Now this deadly "Admiral Ushakov" is a central theme on at least one novel and appeared in many books (use google books). However, our peaceful ship which came to India with same name, otherwise forgotten, appeared only once in a news report in a Madras based newspaper 'The Hindu' two days later after its arrival, January 17, 1959. This report points out that this consignment was a part of a larger deal 'between Nehru's government and USSR'  to supply 'a total equipment worth three million rubels' . 'The equipment' said this report 'comprises mostly electronic engineering apparatus' for 'laboratories for physics, electrical engineering, radio and television instruments on geodesy'.[1]</p>

<p>It is remarkable that this incident was not reported in Bombay based media especially by "Economic <strike>times</strike> Weekly" (now known as Economic and Political Weekly). Alas a newspaper like 'Bombay Chronicle' was dead by now. Possibly they did not find it worthwhile and except Bhabha and Nehru failed to see that these institutes could become envy of the world one day to be visited by Presidents and Prime Ministers.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>International Congress of Mathematics was held at Hyderabad in India this year. Unfortunately, these kinds of events generally lost in the glamor of awards and laudations of few individuals. Mathematicians are weired creatures, at least when it comes to awards. They try their best to keep the novice out of their domain. Engineers are diagonally opposite. Despite of all the claims that their awards are targeted on young people so they can be brought in to research, their rewards do not motivate anyone who gets it. How many awards they give anyway. Two are the most prominent of them which are given by Mathematicians to Mathematicians are <a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2317/stories/20060908004913000.htm">Fields</a> and Nevanlinna Awards. Once in every four years! How many they did motivate in a decade? 2 and a half men! Kid (below 40 years of age) who have got it is already super-motivated and hardly need any support. Already all door are open to him - already a professor in some university!. Funny people.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Women, in general, have attracted the imagination of probably all of the men. They have been quite successful in altering the neural path in almost all of us and have been major cause of turning some of the lunatics in to finest scholars (e.g. Tulsidas and Kalidas) and we probably never know how many were ruined vice versa since nobody keep tracks of loosers. If there are N men alive, guaranteed that they will come up at least N<sup>N</sup> views about women in their total lifetime, mostly contradictory at times. Some of the finest male brains have pondered over the questions of women and found themselves miserably inept at solving this riddle. In their life time, if some of them compared all beautiful and elegant things with women, many of them have devised a huge number of words which are mostly of disapproving nature. Well, there have been many extreme cases which can not be true. Like in <em>Braj Bhasa</em> dialect of Hindi, in <em>Ritikavya tradition of poetry</em>, these guys were over obsessive with female body parts. They compared anything beautiful with woman. Some of them have gone up to the level comparing mountains with female breasts. Scary man! What kind of image they had in mind? Boobzilla!!</p>

<p>Among few of them I've read, Einstein knew very well about the complexity of subject he was handling. As a wise man, he used humor while talking about women. One of the finest thinker in East Asian human history, <em><a href="http://www.womeninworldhistory.com/lesson3plus.html">Confusios</a> </em>have said things about woman which would make him no 1 enemy of feminist (of whatever kind). His least popular depreciation of woman has been one the most fundamental of his thinking, "<em>Women and people of low birth are very hard to deal  with. If you are friendly with them, they get out of hand, and if you  keep your distance, they resent it.</em>" Quite ironically, another Chinese, Mao Zedong, was of the view that in China woman "<em>hold up  half the sky</em>". The comparison don't sit easily given the fact the Confucius still touched deep chord in Chines society.  However, in a move that would have the sage himself raising a  disapproving eyebrow, feminism is being introduced to Confucianism with  the recent decision to recognise, for the first time, women as  descendants of the philosopher. Anyway, 2400 years is a big time.</p>

<p>Back to our India which have its both glorious and dirty history in the matter of women. Manu's views are probably well known. He might have become best friend of Confucius. They both have love to spend time over tea discussing ills of women company.</p>

<p>None of them, however, denied the role woman plays in shaping up a society. Even Manu and Confucius were well aware of the fact that precursor of a society downfall is degradation of woman. Probably that is why they came up with these regressive ideas. Centuries later, Napoleon summed it up in his famous, "<em>Give me good mothers, I'll give you a great nation."</em>. In <em>Mahabharta</em>, a great deal of arguments were made only on women role in a society. Woman agency, as Amartya Sen discussed in his <em>Argumentative Indians</em> was the topic of discussion between Krishna and Arjuna in which Arjuna was worried about the degradation of their character will lead to their kingdom destruction. In fact, the flow of this tale <em>Mahabharata</em> is governed by women only. My favorite part have always been in which Kunti encounters Karna revealing that he is her son. This instant was well captured by <em>Ramdhari Singh Dinker</em> in his <em>Rashmirathi.</em></p>

		<div class="entry"><p>By most accounts, life of a Teaching Assistant (TA) is quite simple. Go to the lab, do the assigned work and come back. If you are TA for a theory course then professor usually asks you to do work related with script checking, grading and other related clerk-work. There is a space for improvement but most of the professors do not want to overburden their TA's. They generally leave them with these routine works. For a M.Tech. (especially first year) this is indeed needed. They have their own tightly packed first year curriculum. But final year M.Techs as well as Dual Degree (D.D.) sure can do more. But its up to the professor to be thoughtful as in how he can utilize them without making them feel like they are being consumed in something they do not want to be a part of. Well, there can be counter argument to this. One can simply say since you get money in exchanged of your services, you have to do what I ask you to do. But I am not a supporter that this kind of '<em>money/market oriented arguments</em>' should be used against young people. They mostly do what is required. However I am not denying that some of them take pride in shunning their responsibilities and corruption should be dealt with. This boring part, we leave to authorities.</p>

<p>Lab courses, where you interact with students are the places where you can really test your capabilities as a teacher as well as a learner. You can easily get the most remarkable assessment of your capabilities - no need to write A, B, C, D exams. Make sure you get at least one lab course while you are a TA else you may live forever in your own illusion of smartness. Well, no one suppose to know everything so its better you don't meet your students with an attitude of <em>Mr. BeenThereDoneThat</em>. The best you can do is to pretend that you have more experience than them so probably you'd be able to help them. And hey, I am also compensating what I have not done in my U.G..</p>

<p>I found out that only a few U.G.'s are hostile to M.Tech. or to Ph.D. in start. Neither they have any sort of superiority syndrome in the beginning. If over the time of they somehow acquire these feelings that P.G.s are '<em>give-up</em>', they must have their own experiences. And who can argue us out from our own experiences. Though there can be a chauvinism among them but generally they are polite enough not to communicate it to you. It's not to say that we don't see thoughtful people in post graduation. There is much more to intelligence that cracking competitions. And there much more to scholarship than intelligence. And of course, there is much much more to thoughtfulness than just being looking serious.</p>

<p>My father did not pass high school (failed miserably in all subjects) but in his childhood he did make awesome things. People in village remember how he made a big tractor out of clay which used to have its own steering system. It was washed away by rains later. This was designed when there was no tractor in my village. Now back home, people asks what have I made. Your father was a real engineer. You are not. They do make a lot of sense to me.</p>

<p>A lot of P.G. have their own biases. That is natural for grown ups. But when you start treating them with your own sense of morality, it will of-course irritate them. Though morality is more of less very desirable thing in herself, but she has her own nasty habits. Her bearer thinks that he/she has solved the puzzle of what is good and evil. She always puts herself on the side on angels. B<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/magazine/13Psychology-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1">esides, she always demands the head of the wrongdoer</a>. Bertrand Russell once wrote, “<em>The infliction of cruelty with a  good conscience is a delight to moralists — that is why they invented  hell.</em>”. I have been told that in ancient Hindu culture there was no concept of hell. You suppose to born again and again till you get their heaven, never to born again. Perhaps, they thought that life on earth is hell enough. I don't think life is as bad as they used to worry about it. Anyway, some of it is expected from a person who spent all his life in jungles and mountains.</p>

<p>In lab, playing around with instruments, doing different things with things, sometime doing naughty things like cheating a bit is what most of the teenagers do. When I think about my own U.G. days, I really feel having no rights criticizing them. But cheating should be punished. Why one cheat (or import) if one is competent enough? Though there are certain conception of good and bad in our head, U.G.'s must be given benefit of doubts. It is not a good idea expecting a great deal of maturity from them. And it is worse expecting that they will only do things unless to make them to do. Though a level of intolerance should be there for academic misconduct and should be made harsher as they advance in their studies. Fortunately such cases are rare but guidelines must be laid out in reasonably good clarity.</p>

<p>Experiments, by their very nature, are not boring. You are rewarded instantly if you get them right. But they can make student frustrated should you stuck somewhere. Debugging is not an easy task. Its takes a hell a lot of dedication and experience and this is what U.G. generally lacks. So the emphasis should be on to acquaint them with fundamental ideas. If you think that experiment is complex for them then you can give them a simple experiment and ask them to understand all the steps. If they succeed in that than you ask them to proceed with the complex experiment with a pat on their back. Marks are probably the thing they are most interested in, so you can tell them that even if you are not able to finish this complex experiments, I am grading you for your performance in the simple experiment.</p>

<p>An emphasis on a particular topic can be stressed or relaxed depending on the interest of the students. Student of microelectronics may like to spend more time on I-V characteristics of a device than it's applications. On the same lines, a student of communication make be more interested in amplifiers than how device functions etc. Well, at U.G. since most of thing are generic and everyone suppose to know whatever they are told to do in lab but I am of opinion that certain sections can be skimmed over while some can be stressed at the cost of others if they seems to be interested in them.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest challenge is how to get close to them without being unreasonably generous. I have certain experiences from past that being friendly with them, some of them start believing that poor performance on their part will be tolerated. They must have reason to believe so since our society has been like that where nepotism is deeply rooted and they can not be much different. There are ways to sort it out by acting professionally till you are their TA's. But making mistakes are allowed if you have certain feedback in you to discover the error of judgment. I did over graded few of students while I was a M.Tech. initially.</p>

<p>One should not be thrifty when it comes to praise them when they work hard. Although praising someone for being smart has its own downside, but the criticism is the last thing an Indian kid need. We get it all the time. <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/27840/">There are repercussion of these kind of praises which IITians generally receive - for being smart.</a> The safest is praising for their effort. Indians are generally very thrifty and mostly jealous in praising their fellow citizen. In criticism, they will be unsparing. My personal experience is if you are NOT able to praise someone, you really have low self esteem or very poor understanding about the stuff you are mentoring them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, grades or marks have been used as <em>ankush</em> by Indian teachers. It is really crass to note that the threat of bad marks is the most ubiquitous arrangement devised by our teachers (Though here at IITB, it is not the only arrangement, both carrot and stick are available). Although marks work fine in controlling students as well as making them work, but there should have been a better way. If you treat your students like morons they will become morons. I believe that this threat generally used by those who either wants to repress students asking doubts or the super moralists who somehow believes that the students are pure evil and will not work unless threatened. Well, in our society where people like the idea of punishing the most marginalized one. For example, committing suicide is crime in India. The guy is already so depressed, last thing he/she needed was to be put in lockup. But that did not stop them to devise this law. What is the logic behind it, if you do it once, we'll make sure you wont do it again? So this is NOT surprising and students who are at receiving must protect themselves from all of it - no matter how much this irritates the authorities. But the solution to this problem, <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/%7Edruzdzel/feynman.html">"How one should teach students?</a>" have not been settled. If a student likes a subject then there is no problem teaching one. But the real challenge lies with students who somehow lost all of their interests.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>When I used to work in NCR (supposedly a part of Delhi), few months ago, we had many people from Delhi in office  - seemingly proud people from Delhi. Interestingly, none of them was more than 1-2 generation Delhites. Perhaps this is the only historic city to have such a large number of ahistoric people. Well, Indians in general are ahistoric. We don't give a damn to our history. For most of us, history starts from 1857 and ends in 1947. If by any chance your history teacher likes Gandhi although the chances are very slim, 6 more months are granted.</p>

<p>In <em>'Last Mughal'</em>, William Darymple, using the mutiny papers as primary sources for his research, showed how British killed the identity of Delhi. The writers, painters, musicians and great family of <em>Shahajahananbad</em> were scattered and in their places merchants and like people were encouraged to move in.</p>

<p>Since then, people are moving in to make money rather than making a city. Strangely, people who have no cultural or historical stake in this city like to be called as Delhites. I don't know the exact reason for this, perhaps its the glamor attached with the idea of calling oneself '<em>creature from the capital</em>' or may be it is just that influence of 'media matters'.</p>

<p><em>Bengalis</em> came in large numbers when the capital shifted from Calcutta to  Delhi, and later its economic growth brought people from other States.  There is a thriving Tamil community, a growing Telugu community, a  Marathi community and, of course, people from adjoining States –  Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar who constitutes its most of the work force.</p>

<p>Historically, Western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab were known for their 'martial races'. These 'martial races' - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_Race">as British used to classify them</a> - are notorious - as expected - for their feudal behavior. In Indian Armed Forces, there are more than 50% people from these three states - at every level.<em> </em>Given a low level of literacy as well as little exposure to the other cultures, they tend to behave in not-no-pleasant ways. In addition, local vernaculars generally sound bad to a person who is new e.g. <em>Haryanavi</em> is perhaps one of the most harsh sounding dialect. You'll never know if they are fighting with you or talking with you.</p>

<p>Lets leave the working class and come to the <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/Kalpana_Sharma/article611470.ece">so called 'educated class' which likes to point fingers</a> at the working class over every mess created here. In every two or three days, you can get the news that some people were driven over by some car. The parking space fights are anyway famous in Delhi. I really can not understand how Reader Digest got Mumbai as the rudest city on the planet.</p>

<p>You talk to any girl in Delhi, and she can tell you very easily how many of them, whether <em>civilized</em> white collar or <em>working class </em>blue collar, behave differently. This is perhaps the only place, where you can see people justifying '<em>eve-teasing</em>'. They may go one step further that woman wears clothes provocatively and being a male, I have no control over my erection. Besides, they've got Times of India! If you look at this paper every morning, somehow you'll be convinced that woman are really objects!</p>

<p>One of the reason why we need people who take pride in their culture is that these people can be easily controlled. All you have to do to make them aware that they are hurting it. People tend to protect whatever form a part of their identity. If culture become a part of your identity, you do every thing to protect it, just like your husband, wife, girlfriend, parents, Indianess, political ideology and whatever. They have to attach with the city not because its a city with glamor, because its their home.</p>

<p>The point is, as Bhaskar Ghosh makes <a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2621/stories/20091023262110400.htm">here</a>, '<em>that an essentially Delhi identity or culture, or image,  has not emerged. It does not exist now, and it may well be a century  before something of the kind does. Because, remember, Delhi as a  metropolis has already spilled over into Haryana and Uttar Pradesh,  where there are distinct and not-very-pleasant characteristics that  surface even as bucolic, placid regions are changed to a mass of  expressways, flyovers, slums and mushrooming buildings, all of them  compounded by a shortage of water and power, and hopelessly inadequate  sanitation and drainage</em>'.</p>

<p>I really don't want to talk about not-so-humble public bureaucrats of this city. By the way, this city does not have the <em>annealing </em>effect which Chennai and Kolkata posses. If you stay long enough, you might develop this habit of being angry and irritated. You simply become like most of them. This city absorbs you. One of my public spirited colleague at office admitted it with melancholy that very few visitors like Delhi.</p>

<p>From the time of the Ghalib, who has famously said, <em>"Who'd leave the streets of Delhi to visit other places" </em>this city suffer for very acute inwardness, something like New York. Marathi people also have this kind of habits but they do not suffer from New York syndrome unless Raj Thackeray start beating the bush around them.</p>

<p>In some sense, that is how a capital must be like, belongs to no one yet you can find the whole country inside. But a city without a culture of its own! No wonder it is so susceptible to Westernization. The very definition of modernity for this city seems to be "<em>whatever is not traditional</em>".</p>

<p>The place where I stayed during my time in Delhi was a retired army officer home, he used to call it,"<em>It's a big village, its not a city.</em>" Being from a village, this offends me. Villages are too small to have a culture of their own, but they compensate it with the sense of community and families.</p>

<p>Their Chief Minister, Sheila is brave enough to think that she can change this attitude of people in record time and NGO's and media are also running the campaign 'Meri Dilli' etc. Simply because those whose behavior needs changing will never identify themselves with the obnoxious characteristics one has mentioned. They  will think someone else is “committing nuisance” in public even as they  line up to urinate against the wall of a protected monument.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>One of our professors at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Electrical Engineering Dept., has this habit of reading people (student) and keeping some sort of views about them. Perhaps we all do this sort of things. I actually do that. It is impossible for me not judging people I meet - trying to be skeptical and not cynical most of the time. Last time, I talked with him after getting admission back in IIT for Ph.D. program, He asked me 'not to smile' when alone. His reason is simple, in this world filled with normal people, you are not allowed to talk to yourself. It is not that you dont give a damn about them but these people can create trouble if you behave in a way which they do not like. Apparently, he also do this sort of things, suddenly some jokes popout in his head and he start chuckling and then if someone sees him he has to pretend as nothing has happened or he starts looking at some trees as a clown is sitting on them. So, do not talk to yourself, and do not smile. Look angry, thats OK! Mostly, I keep listening to music so even I commit the crime of talking to myself or smiling, I can pretend that I am talking with someone on mobile through earphones. Technology for rescue. This old chap is not fortunate enough.</p>

<p>This all is ok with me. Next thing he asked me if I feel DEPRESSED. I refused plainly and he got me thinking. He simply said if you are sleeping more or less than 7-8 hours, you are depressed. Hmmm.</p>

<p>Its remarkable how much you get confused when you go on to understand something more and more. I tried to read about what exactly is depression and got nowhere. All I got is that its really hard to figure out when someone is depressed or not. A philosopher says something about it, a neurologist sees it differently, a poet have some romantic views about depression an so on.</p>

<p>To understand something, one need to have access to some theory or concept. When one does not have access but wants to use one, she much build her own. Like in case of India, every Indian carry their own idea of India in their heart for its really a hard 'word' to define. Its quite a reasonable arrangement this way. Till things settle down for sure, everyone is entitled to their own theory. So I try to come up with my own tools to explore.</p>

<p>For every living creature, there could only be two collection of states. First is the collection of states of body. Second is the collection of state of mind. Depression is surely is a set of of this 'mind' thing. So I defined depression as a collection of states of 'mind'. This mind, a state machine, may not have a single state at a particular time as we have them in 'digital system'. This state machine - hereafter will  be called 'mind' - can have a complex sets of states, overlapping, intertwined, and mostly triggered with 'thoughts' of conscious or subconscious (whatever that mean) part of our being. We have not defined 'thoughts'. But their presence we can be sure of. I can have this certain feeling of having a thought anytime. I might get circular, so I leave it undefined. Now, mind reach to another set of states from her current set of states after processing 'thoughts'. These thoughts can be a aftereffect of our experiences with people, with ideas, with books, with illusions etc.</p>

<p>Now, we need to define one more things, and that is FEELINGS. I like to see feelings a 'thought' which can NOT be understood. Once a thought is understood, it forms a part of logic. You 'know' it so it is not a feeling anymore. If you cherish some feelings, I beg you not to get curious about it. For example, at some age, what we like to call 'love' may turn out to be a simple 'attraction' for beauty, physical desire or hobnobbing with rich and powerful. It's not to say that we can 'understood' it completely anytime. But a more complex feeling of 'love' at some time can be broken down to be less complex feeling after some spending sometime understanding it. That why I say, you love some feelings, do not try to understand it. <em>Ignorance is bliss</em>!</p>

<p>In this definition of feelings, I have classified all the feelings as one. Can I distinguish, which feeling is good (like love, happiness, sympathy etc) and which is bad (anger, envy etc..)?</p>

<p>We now brings in the concept of energy. Almost all of the feelings when active in a alive person needs energy. If one feel anger, one has to loose control over one's brain because one's body now demands as much energy as possible and refuse to grant a share for brain. Mind make it sure that brain does not get its share. (Mind and brain are different things). Anger, is body-friendly feeling. It makes your body active. On the other hand, feelings of love or happiness, kick start your brain and brain demands more energy. Now your body has to make way for your brain. You want to sit down or lay down and contemplate (popularly known as 'feel the moment'). There are other feelings which could be both brain and body extensive, like feeling of motivation. You get up early, work hard and still feel very jolly. Now I can define, which feeling is good or bad.</p>

<p>If you have to work which is very labour extensive like waging a war, yours chance of survival will be much more if you get 'angry'. If you are a philosopher, you need to get rid of these kinds of feelings. Embrace other 'brain-loving' feelings like compassion, seclusion, happiness, depression etc.</p>

<p>Depression is a sort of feeling which have a lot of enemies. Its enemies call themselves 'expert'. Depression is a 'brain-loving' feeling. Higher the depression makes your brain getting over-clocked. Your body start withering, because now your brain is so occupied with itself it does not care whether you need a healthy body. This should be alarming and need attention of yours and then of a trained person. I personally like depression, it gets me thinking and wondering. A little depression is the best thing and must happen to everyone but it should not make you oblivious to your body. Too much of thinking is good for those people who lives tormenting their own soul (known as philosopher - they are respected even if no one wants to live like them). In certain time of history and location, things change their meanings, if for Greeks, <em>hope </em>was the worst of the evil coming out of the <em>pandora box</em> it is now the best of the things. If for old Hindus, <em>satisfaction in small</em> is one of the best trait, now they love _making most our of it. _</p>

<p>I dont know what kind of definition they have when they portray 'depression' as an enemy of humankind. I see it, under our established definition, as a best thing to have. But one great Indian mystic poet (ironically he was illiterate) <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ZGwPOdVoeI0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Kabir&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Kabir</a> </em>said<em> "</em>too much of anything is bad". Our body as well as our brain have their limits, you can not push them to these limits without hurting yourself. But you must not leave them idle also. A little bit of anger all the time is good your body and a little bit of depression all the time is great for your brain.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>There was a time when she was a mother who cared about all of her children. Even in the early day's of her Independence, when she had little to feed all of her children. she managed really well. <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=9078987899127917834#">These days, she only cares about her children who look beautiful. She has long tuned her back on the children who look ugly</a> (as a rule of thumb, villagers and migrant workers). Tribals had never been her favorites. Even in the time of great king <em>Ashoka</em> they were known as '<em>trouble maker</em>'.</p>

<p>By the way, most of us farmers and laborer are oblivion to this facts that she no longer feel our pain. Bloody stupid people, still have the same romantic views of India as Nehru had about her. There are people who call spade a spade but who have access to their writings. First of all, they do write in English (I plead guilty) and regional media does not like them anyway since they can not have an advertisement if they are going to give them space. It is perhaps an irony of ours that even though we are the only one who vote government in and out, still they do not seem to care about us. All these urbane middle class get their ways even though they never vote. Anyway..</p>

<p>We celebrated her Independence in the best way we could. For my father, this day did not matter much for he shaped his world-views (or regional-views) what he saw and felt by himself. He, like most of the not-so-educated farmers do not wonder about this world. They simply know how this world work. This quality is missing in our educated or 'curious' friends. They do wonder a lot and get confused. My mother, though less educated than my father, deliberately refuse to live in reality. She trust radio more than what she sees. What she heard on radio is like old time '<em>akashvani</em>' which has to be true. If they say that there are golden days ahead for India, so it must be true. <em>Prasar Bharti</em> is anyway more sensible then all of other channels put together. She always enjoy the I-day, probably today also she must have felt happiness larger than other days. For her, it is a special day. Today, first on Doordarshan, she would watch that impressive parade and then cook something special perhaps '<em>suji ka halwa'. </em>Then she'd call be and ask me to wake up and take a bath as early as possible but today my incoming are barred. That must have reduced her happiness.</p>

<p>In those childhood days, there were our teachers. They liked this day too. Everyone of them used to come on time on this days in the best possible clothes. Then we'd march in village chanting slogans of freedom fighters and watch the movie on DD in afternoon.</p>

<p>In my childhood, like every other children, I was not critical. In our school library, we did not have Arundhati Roy or George Orwell (Yes, the Hindi translation. I think there wasn't any). We had all the stuff which make you fall in love with India. We had <em>Chacha Nehru</em>. We had Vivekananda. We even had Gandhi. But we did not have all the people who lived in villages and have not-so-romantic views about India. We did not have anything written by Ambedkar or Patel. I lived in my small village in my own daydreams shaped by all the popular people about all the popular things - no space for pessimism.</p>

<p>Then there were cities.</p>

<p>This was the time I start reading elite English newspapers on regular basis. In Chennai, now when I think about it - I was fortunate enough that they could maintain a newspaper like "<em>The Hindu</em>". In our north India, our largest read newspaper does not have a book- review page. Less I say is better about this <em>Times of Idiots. </em>I already had a lot of garbage in my head filled by corporate media. I did not realize that news now mean how many click you can get on it or how much advertisement you can put around it and editors and journalists have been replaced by managers and stenographers. I appreciated this '<em>bazaru</em>' views after all I was dreaming to earn my future bread and butter from this '<em>bazar</em>' only in which I did succeed. I plead guilty.</p>

<p>During my U.G. in Chennai, in the "<em>Communication Skills</em>" exam, teacher asked me to interpret an article. There is something I could still remember. Someone was saying about their Russian newspaper.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>First modified on : Aug 12, 2010</p>

<p>These following notes are not  coherent and need five or six careful readings. The links given in this  posts are worth reading and a lot of the arguments made here are  influenced by these readings.</p>

<p>Our most of the traditional 'love stories' have a tragic end. We do not have 'happily ever after' in our love stories. In addition, these love stories do not contain elaboration of 'romance' or 'romanticism'. Those romantic gestures such as 'first kiss', 'midnight kiss', 'dance' etc. which are an integral part of western love stories are nil in Indian one. Details on 'how both of them starts loving each other?' are also very limited in our stories but the tragic part would be elaborated very well. This also helps making its reader (especially children/teenagers) aware of what are the worst that could happen if they follow that path. A typical Indian love story mainly emphasizes that if you chase your heart you will suffer a lot, most of the time as premature death. Perhaps that explains why Indian are so timid in choosing life partner by themselves. Mostly, they go for arranged marriages, a partner chosen by parents or guardians which have a social approval. However, there is a very steep increase in number of love marriages in urbane India in last decade.</p>

<p>In our stories, the love between the duo is always 'pure' or 'perfect'. Even in our movies - which 'educate' almost all of our teenagers - we are still to see a genre in which male or female protagonist suffer from the 'infidelity' caused by the partner. The challenges which our 'lovers' in our Movies face mostly are the handiworks of society or some '<a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/mag/2002/11/03/stories/2002110300560300.htm">villains' or 'family protecting their so called honors</a>'. <a href="http://epw.in/epw/uploads/articles/10728.pdf">These resistance to love marriages are still there</a>, but the urbane India has shown a decline in these matters.</p>

<p>The most ubiquitous is the teenage love in modern India. Teenagers of India are not studied by sociologist as the way our tribal are studied. Somehow they have shown a tremendous indifference toward them. They go to the far away lands to study the tribal but have failed to produce good social studies on teenagers. Nonetheless, in post face-book time, when you can virtually traceback the life of an individual (with little practice and certain safeguards against bias), the time is ripe for one more M. N.

		<div class="entry"><p>"<em>In the great sense letter-writing is no doubt a lost art. It was killed by the penny post and modern hurry. When Madame de Sevigny, Cowper, Horace Walpole, Byron, Lamb, and the Carlyles wrote their immortal letters the world was a leisurely place where there was time to indulge in the luxury of writing to your friends. And the cost of franking a letter made that letter a serious affair. Carlyle saw that the advent of the penny post would kill the letter by making it cheap ... he foretold that people would not bother to write good letters when they could send them for next to nothing. He was right, and the telegraph, the telephone, and the postcard have completed the destruction of the art of letter-writing. It is the difficulty or the scarcity of a thing that makes it treasured. If diamonds were as plentiful as pebbles we shouldn't stoop to pick them up" -- A. G. Gardiner ( The blogger read this in a letter send to an estimable newspaper The Hindu by </em><strong>V. Jagadeesan, </strong><em>Hyderabad)</em></p>

<p>I wrote my first letter when I was nine or ten year old. An old lady in my village was having problems at home and she wanted to communicate them to her husband who was in military services. She could have gone to other places but revealing personal problems to grown-ups are generally very traumatic. Under the '<em>Imli</em>' tree I was doing mathematics and my mother was cutting the vegetables. She came and sat there and talked with my mother for at least an hour before coming to the point that she wanted me to write an letter for her. She was hoping that my mother would budge from there while I write the letter for her but unfortunately, mom was not in any mood to decline the joy of witnessing the details for someone else personal life.</p>

<p>I took a paper out of my notebook and thought about how should I write a letter. I asked her what she wanted me to write. She perhaps was narrating in her head to make the details look least embarrassing, if any. She aked me write the '<em>things which you write in a letter in opening as gambit</em>' so I wrote, starting from '<em>prannath</em>' and enjoyed writing it. I finished the letter and she posted it without the postages. Apparently, a letter without postages is considered 'written in emergency' and very urgent by the post office, the receiver has to pay for the postages and that relieved her for spending money today. After a month she came back with a letter for me to read. I read it to her and fortunately my mother was not around.</p>

<p>In my Village, receiving a letter was a rare event and rarest was receiving an printed letter. As I sailed into the seas of modern world, I started getting printed letters, sometimes roll-numbers, forms, results, cards etc which made me feel special. I liked them and now I regret that I got what I wished for. Every time I look into mail box, all I get is some computer generated letters (and so they do not need a signature, damn). I never received an hand-written letter till I was 22. Perhaps, feeling the joy of getting a hand written letter is subjective. Not everyone seems to be amused by the idea of wasting so much time and energy on such a trivial matter. But for people like me, it's worth it, even if I have easier options.</p>

<p>I did write a lot of letters and received a few. I wrote to my teachers on teachers days, wrote to few friends, and wrote to you know who without getting a reply. Unfortunately, my mother is not literate else I'd have loved to write her letters. I find it better to use paper as my thoughts carrier rather then using electromagnetic waves even if some <em>Sir Ji</em> making me look like a demon for being the cause in cutting down the trees.</p>

<p>I have been a simple and harmless spirit mostly wander around here and there for pretty and amusing memories.And I have this temptation of day dreaming about all the good things coming true. In my dreams, I do have stupid conversations with myself and sometime I wish I could write them to someone. Nishant has promised me that he would write me back if I write him a letter. I can trust him on this but I thought of making his life less miserable by promising him that for every 3 letters you get you need to write one and do not write भेसाब  as he wrote in a letter to his brother. And if he ever replied back by an email ....</p>

<p>Letters should not be judged by market values and their utility in these troubled modern times. They are written by individuals to individuals. Their own handwriting makes then unique even if they have nothing much to say. This is something I can never get in an email. Their flow, their mistakes, their ink, their flaws, and  yes of course, the full stop, all unique. Last week, someone asked me about a post-box and I was delighted. It is really nice to see that the post-boxes do not have colonies of wasp in them.</p>

<p>What wouldn't I do to have someone to write letters to.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>'Game theory' has it's most unforgiving situation known as 'grim'. If two  parties A and B are dealing with each other under some norms and if one of  them breaks these norms then other once can accept 'grim' i.e. B will  never do business with A again or vice versa. This is very much established that 'trust' is the prime factor among the individuals and organizations which enables them to do business together smoothly. Game theory tries/should try its best to predict how the situation will turn out to be under the changing dynamics of trust.</p>

<p>It is also being established that societies in which 'trust' among people is higher are better off (<a href="http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/faculty/dasgupta/index.htm">see works of Partha Dasgupta</a>). In relationships, trust is perhaps one of the most important factor a sustainable relationships. In low-trust society, people generally do not accept grim. The first few instances of trust-breaking serves as eye opener rather than something enough for accept 'grim'.<em> They think, "We'll be careful next time."</em><strong> </strong>In these societies, breaking trust does not attract as big a penalty as it could have attracted in the land of puritans. For instance, if one cheats on his/her life partner, other generally does not ask for divorce (a situation of 'grim' here). They might easily become careful, vigilant etc but they do not go for the most extreme. While puritans will cry inside himself/herself and will not get satisfied without asking for the extreme penalty i.e. divorce. Which by the a way is the most suitable option for him/her. A puritan (with high and non-negotiable set of ethics) just can't live with compromises. This may or may not make his/her life easier or his/her behavior might not be approved by the society per se but ...</p>

<p>In India, southern states must be having a higher level of trust among them than the northern counterparts. Cases of road rages in outer Delhi at any given day can easily surpass the whole of the Tamilnadu. Well this may be an overstated argument. I have lived in Delhi and Chennai.</p>

<p>Indian corporate media has played and is playing a very grim role in decaying the whatever trust we have between our teenagers of different genders. Most of the stories/news we see in media are generally are the stories where the trust is being broken. The graphic details of these incidence as well as the hypes by media increases the suspicion among the young girls and boys and this is more acute in girls since they are at the receiving ends, mostly. Though this is the job of media to report the incidents but the priorities and the restrain from making is spicy is missing. We too like to read them hence a vicious cycle is made. The assholes on the street demand drugs so the gentleman sells them. If you argue with him why he is selling drugs to them then you know, He is a nice guys, the assholes on the street demand it, what can he do?</p>

<p>The social dynamics plays a crucial part in an individual life if one like/is tempted to be a part of it. In society which is approved of compromising behavior (like easy on corruption or violence), a life of a puritan may be really hard. This is a well established observation that any system is not kind for non-complying entities. In Indian Police, by and large, a non-corrupt policeman is a laughing stock. In a same way, a capitalist is a thing to ridicule among the Marxists. A hardworking farmer may be considered fools by entrepreneurs. But these are the larger pictures and need careful attention of a sociologist.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Reasons to do a Ph.D. could be at most four or five. Any collection of these reasons echoes very tempting in my head (comparatively, pardon my <a href="http://www.galilean-library.org/manuscript.php?postid=43866">set of ethics</a>). Any profession which has low monetary return for relatively hard work generally acquire some sort of respect and dignity (also a sense of morality lingers. Look! I am doing this service and blah blah..). The perception of teaching, research, farming, nursing, social services etc are generally based on <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/feb/24/morality-motivation-dogmatism-judgement">these rules</a> only. Almost all of the social works extract the respect they genuinely deserve by these facts and hardly from the fact that the person who is doing this job consider it a vocation. In a survival society like our where every career is mostly made at the expense of others, it is hard to be convinced that one has taken this career under <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/mag/2009/03/15/stories/2009031550120400.htm">one's free will</a>.</p>

<p>This ought not to mean that people are in these professions are morally superior or more ethical than other presumably lesser mortals. The life of scholars (of whatever kind) is not much different and surely not superior that an ordinary person. Personally, I admire people addicted with something. Choosing these careers might as well be a case of not having other options - which in a way, quite a reasonable argument. A lot of scholars took their jobs in academia after being denied a job in industries (Thankfully!). And one can safely assume they would have spent their life otherwise had the chance been given to them to be a part of better paying industries. For example have a look at the interviews given in <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/%7Emudd/finding_aids/mathoral/pm07.htm">oral history project of Princeton University.</a></p>

<p>Even after spending one's youth in these professions, a lot of people leave these fields when they get the chances later e.g. a professors is taking up administrative work in an university. Few professors who generally lashes out on students for leaving shores for higher studies go abroad to join better universities. 'To serve science better' or some other suitable reasons could well serve as one's vindications.</p>

<p>Picking up teaching, research or related activity as vocation surely do not need any reasons or vindication. In a country like India, where peer-pressure make people make their choices, it is really hard to assume that people will do what they really like unless they are born with strong will-power or live in isolation so that the influence of peers is at minimum. In this post-Facebook India, this phenomenon is more severe than it was in <a href="http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZrJB-MsbWvoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+change+in+modern+India&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XMUQjUXEAV&amp;sig=coegApSPHOtkzkrKB42jFGcvees&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IV4bTJTiJYP7lweD4uWMCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">M.

		<div class="entry"><p>Reasons for choosing a profession could be many. They invoke different reasons to justify their choices. Ultimately one picks a career, or remain in it, after putting a high value on it. Those who are not able to put a high value on what they do, usually feel like 'wasting their life'.  Karl Marx wondered why people act against their will when there is no apparent reason to do so. Sometime, their choice may not turn out to be a vocation and even after spending a lifetime, there is hardly any success worth the name. It is a fact of life that perceptions of different careers varies greatly from individual to individual. <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/mp/2010/01/28/stories/2010012850080200.htm">Lata Mangeskar is sorry for not being a classical signer; Bombay Jayashree argues that her single song "Jara Jara" has given her more recognition than her 25 years of classical singing.</a>
I intend to make a career in the profession of teaching, and as a spin off of it, a researcher. This profession has nosedived towards its nadir and worst, the process has not paused or stopped. The reasons could be various. Among these, one is the low premium which Indian society puts on it. You can easily get some clue by noticing the idea of this society has about Ph.D.. Though the word 'Research' is much appreciated than 'teaching' at any given time. Not because many of them understand the difference between them and have a more respect for one. It is because the idea of 'research' is quite alien to Indians. We are used to the word 'teaching' much more than 'research'. <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/book/idea-natural-inequality-other-essays/0195662598">In fact, the Indian Universities were modeled on the line of OxBriges at starting</a>. These universities were teaching based and the culture of research has not seeped into Indian society up to that level.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Gee... Using FB and criticizing it.. Well, that's the best part of social networking!</p>

<p>If you have few friends on FB or Orkut then you are a loser, and if you have too many, your are kind of a 'social slut' - that's what flies around these days. The common wisdom diffused in our head by corporate media that the 'job-givers' are using them to analyze their potential candidates. That's leaves us in a dilemma. If your friends are few then your chances are higher in 'banking' and less in 'management'... Man! So it has become a 'market norm' rather than a 'social norm'.</p>

<p>In house sociologists of facebook had something to say, "<a href="http://www.economist.com/science-technology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13176775">that the average number of friends in a Facebook network is 120. And when it comes to real, intensive interaction, that number shrinks dramatically. It turns out that the average Facebook male interacts with only four people and the average female with six</a>.</p>

<p>Here is my observation about Facebook users, especially after seeing their "Top 10 friends list", "The chances that someone exists in you top 10 list is much higher if they have the almost same number of friends." The pattern is more acute in undergraduates and school goers.</p>

<p><a href="http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/genes_and_social_networks.pdf">In fact a paper appeared by a respected university has something more to say</a>. It '<em>reveals that social connectivity is partially genetic. Researchers James Fowler, Christopher Dawes, and Nicholas Christakis compared data on 1,110 identical and fraternal twins from 142 schools and found heritability in "in-degree" (how many people call you a friend), "transitivity" (how many of your friends are friends with each other), and "centrality" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon">how easy it would be to play six degrees of Kevin Bacon using you in the role of Kevin Bacon</a> - I dont know who the hell is this guy!.) "Out-degree" (how many people you name as friends), however, is not significantly heritable</em>.' The genes are still not leaving the Human nature. Its been 30 year since the '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene">The selfish genes'</a> was published and still echoes in our intellectual landscapes This is not highly doubted after in a seminal paper '<a href="http://www.mentaalkapitaal.nl/docs/Nature%20-%20The%20Mental%20Wealth%20of%20Nations.pdf">Mental Wealth of the Nation</a>' it has been settled that genes plays (if any) at most 15-20% part. Even if leave genes alone, this research says that the "<a href="http://www.blogger.com/goog_568002349803">200 male college students, put them in groups for the purpose of planning a party, and then had them rate each other's likability. It found that the most popular students were the most likely to bust the budget or suggest illegal stuff like drugs</a><a href="http://www.blogger.com/goog_568002349803"> and hookers. They also tended to carry a variation of a serotonin-receptor </a><a href="http://www.blogger.com/goog_568002349803">gene</a><a href="http://news.msu.edu/story/5774/&amp;topic_id=10"> associated with impulsivity and rule-breaking behavior. Everyone likes the bad boys</a>." In India, this behaviour might not be that acute but the patterns could be the same.</p>

<p>How can you have, as the authors write, "too much of a good thing?" They hypothesize that "Individuals with too many friends may appear to be focusing too much on Facebook, friending out of desperation rather than popularity, spending a great deal of time on their computers ostensibly trying to make connections in a computer-mediated environment where they feel more comfortable than in face-to-face social interaction."</p>

<p>A copy and paste from this paper, "<em>Finally, social networks may serve the adaptive (or maladaptive) function of being a vehicle for the transmission of emotional states (38), material resources, or information (e.g., about resource or __partner availability) between individuals. Some traits that appear to spread in social networks also appear to be heritable (such as obesity (20, 39), smoking behavior (40, 41), happiness (42, 43), and even political behavior (22, 23, 44–46)), suggesting that a full understanding of these traits may require a better understanding of the genetic basis of social network topology</em>."</p>

<h2>POLITICAL MISUSE  </h2>

<p>Ever wonder why Iranian ,Indian, and Chinese finds it easier to enter US campuses despite that US governments hated/hates these countries. We all know how 'Indira Gandhi' was called bitch by a US president and the newspaper greeted her with this headline, "Here comes Indian PM with a begging bowl'. Or the US secretary of States comes to India when US-Indo Nuclear deal and says, "<em>Mr. Prime Minister, We'll make you great!</em>" Followed with the national dailies headlines, "<em>India Nuked"</em> and all the celebration. China had been the biggest foe of US but still maximum students are in US are from China. Iran also sees the same pattern. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/07/world/asia/07iht-air.4509556.html">A white paper coming out of think tank</a> suggest that, "<em>India can be a easy ally of US since a lot of people in power are educated in US unlike the previous generation which was largely Europe educated and naturally anti-US." </em>Well seeing the development, this indeed worked really well. No <a href="http://beta.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/article243734.ece">longer Bhopal gas tradegy is concern and a bill is now being introduced so that the companies do not have to run away.</a> Monsanto and Enron had already done their part. US had shown enough character with Tarapur reactor.</p>

<p>Facebook is in the reach of elites of this nation. It represents the collective psyche of this class. Just break into the Facebook server and Hey Presto!, '<em>You have the whole thinking of a nation in your hand</em>'. Now design your policy according to them. If the nation is sex obsessed then <a href="http://www.geekologie.com/2009/03/hands_down_the_worst_advertise.php">you have the gal to make ads like this</a>. And make a controversy as they did with 'veil' in Muslim world. A Nobel Laureate and Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk reveals than in 1905 there was no v<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headscarf_controversy_in_Turkey">eil to be found in northern Turky, girls used to run around with bare head and on cycles</a>. When a french opera house came there for a show they have to travel 200 miles in southern Turkey to get a 'hijab'. After they [West] hit on 'veil', they [Muslims] tried to hit back and tried to prove their identity by embracing the 'Hijab'. [Snow - a Novel]. How much energy they could have put in their development rather than defending their identities. A few words can bring a nation down.</p>

<p>Already Google is giving clues how to woo a consumer, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2cqlw3pwFw">even if there is nothing logical between the ad and product</a>. Now, you can have clues how to woo a nation. Once you know the popular mentality is tilted towards US in the one of the most 'ass-licking' form, they go ga ga with all their US policies. Even the government does not hesitate to put McKinney consultants on RBI board - which would recommend to give subsidy to corporates a whopping Rs 1 crore a minute while their Public Distribution System is in doldrums due to lack of funds.</p>

<p>Information will be the next 'WMD'. With so much of information available, who ever control it will control the world. Others will only ribbit some times of other. Its high time India (and her citizen) finds her (their) missing global voice (as China is doing now) if she wants to remain sovereign. Followers never lead.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p><a href="http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=baldwin&amp;book=fifty&amp;story=bruce">Have you heard a story of a spider which never lost hope and ultimately succeeds to climb up the roof of the cave</a>. And a guy watching it ultimately learned the lesson that 'never lose hope.'</p>

<p>As a little girl pointed out in her school, spider never lost hope because it had none. But that's all right, if a right lesson is being learnt from false facts?</p>

<p>One of the best English movies, "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/">Shawshank Redemption</a>"  is themed around the hope. It epitomise the ultimate power of Hope, winning over <strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000151/">Red</a>'s argument, "</strong>Let me tell you something my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane."</p>

<p>I could not locate how in Hinduism, Hope was treated. There is vast resources out there on Greek's. One goes like this,</p>

<p><em>Hope was personified in Greek mythology as </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elpis"><em>Elpis</em></a><em>. When </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora"><em>Pandora</em></a><em> opened </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_Box"><em>Pandora's Box</em></a><em>, she let out all the evils except one: hope. Apparently, the Greeks considered hope to be as dangerous as all the world's evils. But without hope to accompany all their troubles, humanity was filled with despair. It was a great relief when Pandora revisited her box and let out hope as well. It may be worthy to note that in the story, hope is represented as weakly leaving the box but is in effect far more potent than any of the major evils"</em><br/>
<em><br/>
</em><br/>
What exactly could Hope be? Benefit analysis when there is 'zero' cost.</p>

<p>People give argument that <em>there is hope</em>. But most of these situations are those in which there is nothing to loose (and a something to add) e.g. in teen-age relationships. <em>Lets see if its work out with her(him), there is a hope</em>. Here we see even if the chances are slim, people invoke 'Hope' to try it. But when the cost is not 'zero' like jumping across a river in which there are crocodiles, poeple do not invoke the same argument here, "<em>Lets try there is hope."</em></p>

<p>Other situations are in wars. Soldiers do a lot of dare-devil things out of Hope. But again one may ask whether in those situations they had less risky options?</p>

<p>Perhaps, (false hope?) Hope arises when there is no less risky way out e.g "Lets be hopeful" before the result declaration. There is nothing else you can do about it otherwise the cost is worries.</p>

<p>People who day-dreams a lot and think of all good things to come (even without doing anything about it) (like myself) do suffer with this hopeful-ness. But trust me it improves one's life, makes one happier. Even if is the worst evil, as Greek considered it, it the best worst thing ever.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>You would never get tired people telling you that we are living in the age of smartness.In fact, there are <a href="http://www.blogger.com/goog_1268022197415">few organisation who has taken the '</a><em><a href="http://www.blogger.com/goog_1268022197415">theka' </a></em><a href="http://www-07.ibm.com/ibm/ideasfromibm/in/smarterplanet/?ca=apin_smartplanet_2009025&amp;me=psearch&amp;met=google&amp;re=smart_planet&amp;s_tact=initwh001&amp;cm_mmc=apin_smartplanet_2009025-initwh001-_-k-_-google-_-smart_planet"> to build a smarter planet.</a> While I was doing boring stuff with Google to help finding me papers I can cite in my M. Tech. thesis, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/6868/">the Atlantic magazine came out with an article that Google is making us dumb</a>. The most respected research magazine Nature had an opinion about it. It is worried that a lot of author are just citing the reference without even reading them and also developing an habit of not going to libraries to browse journal and stumbling upon something very new. Instead they use internet to search, i.e. to search what they already have an idea about hence the chances are very less to come across something different. (Sorry can not locate the link, trust me it's been like that. - will put it here once found.) But if you google, chances are very extreme that you'll hit something which you have no idea about.</p>

<p>There are few people who lives a lot of time in future. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/07/get-smarter/7548/">One of them claims that technology has made us very smart.</a>The 'fluid intelligence' —the ability to find meaning in confusion and to solve new problems, independent of acquired knowledge. Fluid intelligence doesn’t look much like the capacity to memorize and recite facts, the skills that people have traditionally associated with brainpower. As to say that the generation who copies wiki links and consider itself smarter than the previous generation just like a drunkard who thinks that he can drive.</p>

<p><a href="http://dilawarsays.blogspot.com/2010/02/tweet-it-down.html">Then there was tweeter</a>. Now people tells me that they do not read my blogs because they are long. Keep it small. But how can I express myself in tweets.</p>

<p>Not everyone is amused with technology. <a href="http://www.rle.mit.edu/rgallager/">Prof Gallagar </a>came to IIT Bombay for a <a href="http://gjubilee.iitb.ac.in/IITGoldenHome.do">golden jubilee lectures</a>, and asked everyone to keep the things simple (one of my Matka DSP project partner, He inferred, "<strong>Do not do research.</strong>"). He was concerned about that every year they pile up crap on MS-Word and it does things less efficiently. Prof. Narayanan also does not like this crapping up. He built the fastest circuit simulator <a href="http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/vlsi/wb/pages/slides/networkanalysis_hn.pdf">(BITSIM)</a>. A market-oriented student of him telling him since the simulator spends only only 10-16% on real computations, its not worthwhile for market. So you see some awesome, breathtaking GUI's on the worst of the software (yes, I meant Windows 7). Software development! Every new version must have a better GUI. No once cares what is behind it. Not even technology students.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Post office is located at the end of the IIT Bombay campus. My inland letters were finished, I went there to buy them. To enter this PO, either you first get out of the IIT Y-point and then get into it or you can jump over a four feet wall. I took the easy step. I jumped in.</p>

<p>After I bought the letters and came out, three guys were waiting for me outside. They were of course harsh and the worst form of <em>Marathi Manoos </em>I'd ever came across. Much better than a normal Haryanvi Jat by the way. They took my id card and asked me to collect is from Dean, Student Affair. It happened two days before Dussera 2009.</p>

<p>After the Dussera holiday, I'd go to the Dean SA. I saw the name which sounded like a South Indian. I was relieved. I thought that now there are more chances that this guy will listen to me before making up his mind. But I was wrong about it. He was another <em>Marathi Manoos.</em> After giving me lecture in Marathi on how a person from UP should behave and Thakerey is out there to break my leg, he said the four letter f-word. Yes, you are right!  Fine. "<em>What kind of fine?"</em> I asked. "<em>Monetary". Rs 1000. </em>I bit my nails and another four letter f-word appears in my mind. Fuck! But I did not argue with this pig-head, a quality which is admired in India, it was reduced to Rs 500.</p>

<p>Regionalism is seen in India in one form or other. What he said was not depressing or frustrating. You can see the success of Shiv Sena or MNS over there, it speaks a lot about this <em>cosmopolitan </em>city. I think politicians as the applied-social-scientist who tell people what they like to hear. This issue was not worth thinking about. What I catches my mind was the four letter f-word. Fine.</p>

<p>I have the habit of paying fine. Late submission of library books is the most prominent. I don't feel bad about it, neither I've met one who feels bad about it. The library fine is quite low, Rs 0.50. The library cards also has an additional line mentioning that, "<em>Someone else might be waiting for it.</em>" Had there be no fine, would I submit my books on time (why? We'll see) . <a href="http://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/gneezy/docs/fine.pdf">I used to wonder. Then a study in Haifa, Israel came to approve my apprehensions.</a></p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Why now? Well, March is coming, and I feel romance in this month (and in September) for various reasons. One ofcourse that this time, Nature sheds its old clothes and wears new, and my birthday also falls in this month. Besides, living in Delhi means after the long and chilling cold<a href="http://www.stlyrics.com/songs/t/troggs11047/loveisallaround350937.html">, your fingers and toes are now spared to feel</a> anything but cold. And if you are from a Village in North India then the glimpse of 'mustard field' in March make you understand the whole concept behind the the song 'Yellow' by Coldplay. Yes, these fields suits well with this song.</p>

<p>This year was less embarrassing/trouble-less since valentine day was on Sunday. No office!! so there war no one to ask things. So I spend all of my Sunday in my room reading the books just arrived who was written by scholars who might never had wondered about Valentine Day (or perhaps Romance must have happened in their mind). When I got tired after reading the same stuff, I borrowed 'Times of India' from one of fellow Paying Guest. <em>Debonair</em> could have been a better option, but you can not ask for it from anyone. There is no reluctance here since it is called a newspaper, more acceptable idea. I read it, and guess what,<a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/specialcoverage/5564293.cms"> I realised how much the idea of romance has changed.</a> My favorite newspaper, TheHindu, is very boring. It does not have any sexy things (girls?) in it, not even in its city supplements. Perhaps that is why it is called 'leftist'. There is no advertisement of '<em>Meethi meethi baatein karo</em>' and worst, no horoscope. I got an awesome knowledge on romance, that mainly deals with sexy gifts, sexy sex, sexy touch, and not to mention sexy articles. Its was a delight to read, most of the article help you to convince yourself that the soul purpose of the girls are to please men. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/feb/26/sexualisation-children-parental-guidance-editorial">But this is only a tip of iceberg</a>. And who would mind reading something sexy. But curiosity kills every joy. But even if you read non-sexy things to feed your curiosity then also after some time while lying in you bed you realize that more you know, more frustrated you get since you have control over nothing.</p>

<p>This idea of romance (the corporate media definition) is only for dudes. The first objective of dude-hood is to get laid as early as possible else you are not dude enough or are simply gay. There are few many non-dudes around. Unfortunately, I grew up reading them like Premchand, Dinker, Mahadevi Verma, Jaishankar Prasad, Harishchadra, Shukla, Purn Singh, Agyey, Renu, Kamala Das, Renu and many other poor Hindi-writers; so in spite of colossal opportunities that a sugarcane field provide in my Village, I am still virgin. Thats not to say that it is part of my dignity, more or less it is the lack of enthusiasm in these kinds of stuff. Stuff, which Indians generally consider/considered unethical.</p>

<p>But education can kill <a href="http://www.galilean-library.org/manuscript.php?postid=43866">any ethics</a>. There are lot of magazines just to do that. I could have really dropped down the idea that casual sex is unethical, had I been an ardent reader of TOI, which I am not, or an ardent watcher of M.TV, which I am not either. Worse I read Ruskin Bond, who says in his book 'the India I love', ".....since the possibility of romance was there in my life, I declined his offer to go with him to prostitute..." I liked it, and ignored the fact that he got neither. But I'd love to live his life, so I keep his advise; or should I take clues from 'Dev-D'. Anyway, I like the way I am ruining my sexual life.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/valentines-day">Valentine Day</a>, now epitomises the day of romance, is grossly commersiled. Neither I like it, nor I ever get the chance to do so. In my school days, unlikely for someone from Village those days, I knew about this day. This day, I never had anything to say, a rare thing to happen otherwise. Anything controversial in India (especially in North) becomes part of her culture. So we are seeing the the emergence of Valentine day not because that it really means anything to Indian-love (we have so many role models, Laila Majnu, and otehers.. just go google) but it gives the opportunity to build brands values. So on one hand Bajrang Dal, Shiv Sena etc can increase their brand values in their supporters by demonising it, and on the other hand corporate media can gets its own share by supporting it and ofcourse never forget the market, giving special discounts on viagra. And we, a poor generation, who is got caught in having a casual relationship and soul-mate hunting, just can't get less confused. We accept it,quite blindly and get more confused about what is romance and then to kill this confusion we turn to check our compatibility with the one we suppose to love with 'Kundli Pro' (astrology) and not to <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life/relationships/man-woman/Formula-to-predict-time-for-love-marriage/articleshow/5560031.cms">mention all the other compatibility test</a>, travesty of statistics. Who says <em>'andh-vishwas</em>' will die with education? But if a rural fold do it, he is '<em>andhvishwasi'</em>. If a degree-holder does it, well that you should know!</p>

<p>Lets leave 'why valentine?' altogether<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/feb/12/valentines-day-commercialised">. Others have a lot to say</a>. The very purpose of this day seems to express your feelings. These days Valentine Day's cards sold over 1 billion around the world. I wonder who was the first man who send this card. He must have been very shy or very unattractive or both (Hunchback of Notre-dam? Nah.. thats Disney, they are too dreamy!!) and must have send it anonymously knowing very well that it could never be requited. For their recipients, it could bring the joy at guessing who was the poor creature who fancied them ( They might have used it to increase their reputation among <em>peers</em>, Thankfully for him there was no mobile, orkut or Facebook those days else before his message reaching her, others gossips would have reached him.).</p>

<p>These day, yes in my time, people use text messages and emails (which I also tried, and now horribly regret the very idea) which by the way reaffirmation of a relationships which suppose to exist in his mind (yes, that what I meant by regretting the very idea, it might have been slightly offensive also.) People argue that don't tell her the truth about how you feel or else you will scare her, or a relationships always starts with pretty lies. Reallly? I continued with writing letters, not anonymously (this is just sissy). And I use postal services, who the hell will train a pigeon! Anyway it helps since its very hard for me to open my mouth in front of a girl I like, this is also quite sissy, but it is good also, unless I speak there is hope!! (Personal advise : Do not write email, sms or letters after watching 'Little Manhattan'. Honesty seems to scare a hell out of people! ).</p>

<p>The idea of romance is really strong unless one is not an animal, which are a lot these days in human form. But 'romance with whom', that idea might disappear overnight to be replaced with the idea of someone else - more or less - (As Beatles loved to sing... <em>Love has the nasty habit of disappearing overnight..</em>But they can not be trusted.. They also sung..<em>In my life...</em>Oh the lover of memories.. First sign of getting old). Few ideas are really hard to hold on to, no matter how dear they are to you. Well, thats life (or character?). Cant say....<br/>

		<div class="entry"><p>Once, during my post graduation, I did an unusual thing. I was not walking alone. I was going from my Hostel 9 to Char-2 lab with two more guys. On the course of our voyage, we were intercepted by a bunch of girls. As usual, one of us started staring at someone among them. Someone among us remarked, "<em>Dekh salla kaise ghoor raha hai.</em>" (Look! How is he staring at her.). At this, I told him, "<em>Ghoorega to sochegi ki 'perverse' hai, nahi dekhega to sochegi ki 'gay' hai.</em>" (She might think that he is perverse if he stares, otherwise she will think he is gay). Guys found it very amusing.</p>

<p>Once I and Robin went to Lake-side having our hands on each other shoulders. Many people looked at us and there were definite smiles on their faces. I told Robin that public is taking a wrong view about us. One of my lab-mate once told me that she passes remark of homosexuality whenever she sees two girls walking together holding hands. I myself never missed the chance passing the comment of "So cute!" whenever I saw Gaurav and His friend taking a stroll.</p>

<p>At another time, one of classmate was asking me if I have  seen Health Minister of India in news so much. Those days, our health  minister was trying to legalize homosexuality in India.</p>

<p>Then there was poster hanging in front of SOM inviting everyone to take part in the debate about homosexuality at the same time when I was busy making poster about my project work. That indeed is a curious case. Meanwhile, my all time<a href="http://www.littlemag.com/"> favorite magazine </a>came out with "Sex Determination".</p>

<p>Homosexuality! The most popular definition of homosexuality deals with penetrative sex. Many of cases which came out in public; from Alan Turing to Elton John globally, all of them involved the idea of 'penetrative sex'. The case has been so if it is between man, and an approval of men that this indeed is a case of queer if it is between women . The non-English India, which in 97% of it, has a different take on homosexuality. They simply do not like to discuss it in these terms. Taking about homosexuality in public is a prerogative of anglo-phonic Indians. Among college students, this is a widely talked about topic. However, there is a confusion about what exactly is a homosexual behavior. When I was an undergraduate student, one of my room mate was wondering, "<em>Yaar, in case of a boy there is a real sex, kind of penetration...but in case of girls .. ummm.. there is no real sex..</em>" Then he became thoughtful to an unusual degree. Later he relieved himself by playing Pocket Tanks.</p>

<p>Next day I told my room-mates a joke. Once Santa proposed to a girl and she said, "No, I am lesbian." Santa asked, "What is a lesbian?" "I like to have sex with girls." At this Santa replied, "Wow! Then I am also a lesbian." Oh! Gaonwala (The Villager) is cracking sophisticated jokes. They replied. Somehow, they believe that debating or talking about homosexuality is a sign of sophistication if not of modernity.</p>

<p>Madhuri Dixit was perhaps the first female superstar of India rose to prominence with some path breaking female-centered role.e.g. <em>Ansso Bane Angare (</em>Tears turns into Fire), <em>Anjaam, </em>Mratyudand etc. One of the most controversial song, "<em>Choli ke peeche kya hai"(</em>What is behind the blouse?)<em> </em>definite has a queer element in it. About this song my Hindi teacher in High-School would say, "<em>Bhai</em>, if you see it in other prospective, Then 'Choli ke peeche' is mother-milk also." But one of us was not convinced. He went to argue with the teacher that this indeed was an assault on our culture. He did not say it in sophisticated way. The language he used is what <em>Bajrang Dal</em> or <em>Shri Ram Sene</em> would use. Anyway none of them see it any sort of homosexuality there. There was no doubt a queer element in it and this queer element was high-lightened by a singer voice which , though of female, but very husky as to inhibit a male element. And if you have seen the dance steps in this song, there is nothing that'd quell your doubts about it.</p>

<p>Majority of Indians still alien from the idea of homosexuality. Perhaps the most funny scene about the perception of female-homosexuality is in the movie, 'Bend it like Beckham'. When Juliet's mother was hysterical and throws the word 'lesbian' in accusation at Parminder during a family wedding, an elderly aunt says, "<em>Lesbian? But she is born in march. I though she is Piscean.</em>" Another adds, "<em>She is not Lebanese, she's Punjabi.</em>" The idea of lesbian is very remote from center-stage of Indian mass culture. I am pretty sure many Indian will confuse themselves about the behavior of 'Kantaben' from 'Kal Ho Na Ho".</p>

<p>The place where I was born, Nichalpur, a typical Indian Village, has no conception of homosexuality. Though there may have been some cases found out but never been talked in public, not even in gossips. A nearby town, Seohara, where I did my schooling, is quite different. Cities and villages are better than towns of India in handling their sexuality. Once I went to visit one of my friend at his home and He advised me not to come that early or that late. Since I was just five feet tall and was girl-like in composure, too young to be in 12th standard. He told me without much fuss, " <em>Ye Budhdha log, Sallo se khada hua nahi jaata par gand marne pahle chal dete hai."</em> (These old guys, they can not walk properly but will be the first one to sodomize you.) I never visited him at his place again. Again, once when I was having a hair cut at a saloon, the barber - Indian barbers are famous for telling a lot of stories - obviously jealous of one of his <em>chela </em>who left him and went to Dubai and become rich was telling one of the many present in his shop, "<em>Bhai woh [people in Dubai] log peeche ke shaukin hote hai. Paisa to isne kamaya hai par ab ye insaan nahi raha."</em> (In Dubai, those guys are fond of back-side, He, no doubt made money, is no longer a man.").</p>

<p>Another place in my life which is is left here are the books which I am very fond of reading. Since my childhood I never spared any book I could get my hands on. The best time I spend in my life was in IIT-B library, founding the oldest books available and leaving my signature somewhere in the book was something I really loved to do. But before that, I used to buy and borrow a lot of books in Hindi whenever I traveled from Nichalpur to Chennai. The journey took almost 2 full days and in two days I would savor Premchand, Jaishankar Prasad, Phanishwar Das Renu, Dinker, Mahadevi Verma, Translation of Tagore, Maxim Gorky, Tolstoy. Hindi literature (at least the one I read) never discussed sexuality openly. Only Gandhi has the guts to say such things openly. The first story I've ever read about homosexuality was '<a href="http://media.opencultures.net/queer/data/indian/Lihaaf_or_The_Quilt.htm">Lihaaf</a>' (the quilt) by late Ishamt Chaugati. Nothing of the exposure to this world I ever got through reading fiction prepared me for this. Later there was an overdose of <em>Steven Stifler</em> ( from <em>American Pie</em> ). For next few days I would comment, "Potential lesbians on the road!" or "Potential lesbians alighting bus." One of my room mate would wonder, "Are you getting sex addict."</p>

<p>This much of my journey in life cutting across the various facets of India tells me that 'homosexuality' still has a long way to go. Personally, I am not very much approved of it. Some ideas, no matter how rational, are hard to digest. Just like the idea of 'spending 100 rupees on a cup of tea' is not as digestible as 'spending 100 rupees on a cup of coffee'. Our culture shapes our predispositions. Few alien ideas, no matter how much they have been around you, are too strange to digest. Aren't they?</p>

<p>To be sure, the idea of homosexuality is itself borrowed from a different culture. Kamasutra might have something of it. In Western culture, as far as I can tell from my experience by watching their movies, they find it easy to label anyone as homosexual if he does not ogle over different sex. This paragraph <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1597266.ece">in a news report </a>is reveals the cultural blindness of accuser.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Apparently I am loosing my mind........</p>

<p>Second time...</p>

<p>First time It was claimed when I watched "American Pie". Why? It was my first movie in color. Must have been a cultural shock for a village yokel. I was just fresh out of my village. Never traveled so far away from my home. Never by train. Never seen a tube-light before (only bulbs and that's too in the nearby town).. Indeed, it was my first encounter with the modern world, as it is believed.</p>

<p>But this time, it is not because of cultural shock. It is because I have been expressing myself more openly and, in fact, in the way I should not be. Its time to revisit.....</p>

<p>Once one of my room-mate was saying, "Its easy to go on a Date in Kolkata, But having sex in almost impossible." I remarked, "In my village, You can have sex but it is impossible to go on a Date."</p>

<p>Then there were Lolz.......</p>

<p>It is pleasingly easier situation than any of the situations I have seen in 'American Pie' and you could expect that a guy coming from that sexual-liberated society not to loose his mind (pun intended). There is a knowledge for you, "<em>If you see sugarcane fields in any Village, sex is as easy as making money in this world.</em> <em>Ever wonder why Kamdev's bow is made of Sugarcane</em>!!" As Mark Twain once said, "You need not to be smart for making money, You just have to know how to make money.(<a href="http://beta.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/article109881.ece">See, chapter on poverty and inequality</a>)" That holds in the case of Sex also. I never fit in my village, neither in this modern world.</p>

<p>But I am concerned with this time loosing-mind. When I first took on Times of India, one of my FB-friend confronted. Never by giving any references but by '<em>I think</em>' and '<em>Hindu padhke tu chutiya gaya hai Gaonwale, ye leftist paper hai.</em>" Once he even commented that "<em>look at you, talking all this, want to run away from real problems and want to do a Ph.D.</em>" Perhaps He did not like the tone of it and deleted it to replace it with more neutral comment. Comment which appeared on my Facebook page did not contain these damning words. He might be oblivious to the fact that Facebook sends an email every time you submit a comment. That indeed is great problem with online publishing. It can not be undone once you've done it.  One must be careful about his/her privacy. Second time, when I blog my <a href="http://dilawarsays.blogspot.com/2009/11/open-letter-to-richeswould-be-riches-of.html">open letter to riches/would be riches of this great-nation</a>, He commented, "<em>Why don't you become a richie</em>" and then again, He deleted it. Few days ago I was confronted again first with an advise and then, when I pushed him more, by harsh words. But this person had always been very polite.</p>

<p>This calls for why people who are generally do not have express opinion in public become so much disturbed that they make it a personal confrontation rather than a cool-headed debate on general issue. I admit that I am the first one who try to make it a personal issue and then backs off from all of these. For two reasons, one, taking it personally will trouble my thinking process and I'll spend a significant time to counter-argue him/her rather than worrying about general picture. Second, without hurting someone sentiments you can not get what one really thinks.</p>

<p>So why people get pissed off! Consider a child. Just criticize his/her parents in front of him/her, (s)he will get angry whether (s)he is able to retaliate is other issue. Now this child grows up and starts making fun of same parents but if you criticize his/her girlfriend/boyfriend, (s)he might get really pissed off. You might always be right. The issue is identity. First parents were his/her identity. This child is known by their name. In college, His identity is a separate one from their parents so He does not have to protect this identity which contribute nothing to his. His girlfriend now forms a significant part of his identity, He has to protect it for he no longer known as Mr. X but by the '<em>setting</em>' of Ms Y. The time He is out of his college, She no longer an identity of His (or vice versa) And we see a lot of breaking ups after college and starts doubting whether love does exist. These cases happens mostly after marriage. A wife is not as strong identity as a girlfriend even though she is called as '<em>Ardhangini</em>' - the other half. So protecting the part of identity your wife which contributes to yours is not an issue. But you can not hurt your girlfriend as openly. The dynamics of identity in this relationship is still evolving and had been shaped by rather more liberal point of view. Its not to say that GF's are not physically abused by BF's.<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/sep/01/teenage-sexual-abuse-nspcc-report"> But in India this problem is not as adverse as it is in UK</a>. Or perhaps we have to see it since there are relatively very few teens in those situations in ALL OF THE INDIA.</p>

<p>In fact, a stronger identity of one's wife threatened a men's identity. When Sita (in Ramayana) was able to lift a bow which was so heavy, Janaka, He father, fainted. Not because he was awestruck by the sheer strength of his daughter but by the fact that she might not be able to get married. From where He could find a groom stronger than her. A man should be stronger than his wife? That was an identity of a men in those day and still is. A female boxer can only marry a man boxer. And if one do not do that, there will be jokes. In these days, A man should earn more than his wife? It is a modern identity of man. When this identity is threatened, you see some ridiculous cases coming out in public. It roughly translated into ego-clash. So you see a highly-educated girl or a girl earning much either single of marrying someone who by the way is not interested in her capabilities. A normal man (the most prominent species these days) would not like the idea having stronger wife (both physically or monetary). But one might not be having problem of the girl is stronger in ethics, character, morals, compassion for they are not valued in the '<em>Markets of Society</em>'. So you see people giving advice to girls not to become IAS for after that they can only marry an IAS. What a fucking stupid world I came to born in! It must have been made by a force who had the very sarcastic sense-of-humor. More sarcastic than Chandler Bing.</p>

<p>Next time you want to make a guy/girl pissed off. Just figure out his/her identity and attack it.</p>

<p>The lame Hindus who never confronted and fight the foreign powers with the identity 'Indian' showed remarkable '<em>veerta</em>' in burning, raping and maiming helpless Muslims in Gujrat when they felt that their 'hindu' identity is threatened. Same is true with Muslims and Americans. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clash_of_Civilizations">Its not a clash of civilizations as it appears as the title of this link, it is the clash of identities</a>. You can abuse India in front of mostly Indians and came out without a black eye, just try to do it with 'Hiduism' or "Muslism' etc. Once a guy in my hostel (H9 -Pluto, IITB) thrashed another guy who was constantly criticizing Indian cricket team when It was loosing. Amazingly the guy was Bengali who are generally very soft.</p>

<p>So a market-worshiper identity is threaten when some-one preach equality and so gets a flak for it. Same is with the TOI and HT, if you love this newspaper, you see the world as they want to show you. They make you take pride in those papers with all the emotional campaign (mostly on the anniversaries) and hence they form a part of your identity in you. To make argument you start, 'in TOI that day'. A much more subtle and less biased version could be, "have you read P. Sainath published in The Hindu yesterday?" That is the difference between ardent Hindu and and ardent TOI reader[1]....</p>

<p>In India, the land I work in to make a living, has a peculiar habit. If something is going wrong in your house with you and wrong-doers are the members of your family, you are not suppose to make noise for it might disturb the neighbor. All izz well, you must be chanting all the time. And if you speak (just like Arundhati Roy) you are confronted with a tempting argument "Its easy to figure out a problem rather than solving it."</p>

<p>Once Prof H Narayan in one of the assignment gave us a problem. The problem was, in fact, that we have to come up with a problem, explore it, understand it and try to find out a solution.(with a waring to me, <em>You are creative but you also have to right).</em> Just try do it yourself. An hours passed, and I was looking at my paper and thinking of the song, '<em>Mera jeevan kora kagaj, kora hi rah gaya." </em>(My life was a blank paper, as it remains so.)</p>

<p>In our life almost all of the problems -if you look closely - are made by someone else, say peer pressure which I found so much on the students of IIT-B, surely they have extra-human capabilities to sustain these identities all along. I could not do that, just cant!!). Why you need a solution if you can stop a problem when It was evolving. You never had to solve this economic crisis had the regulation was in place. But the process of creating a problem is 'profitable' for some, and all people are not blind. They speak and try to point out that your are creating a problem. But these '<em>educated' _ people have to remove this obstacle. So they came out with this statement. How intelligent! "**</em>The only thing they know is crib and  question! Its easier to question and be a question rather than to find  or be a solution !_**" So be quiet when we are making a problem, then you can criticise and solve it while we busy ourselves to make one more (sure there is supply and demand).</p>

<p>The rabble rouser!! If you a management students then you might be hearing these days, even in <a href="http://hbr.org/">Harward Review of Busines</a>s, that for an organization to work well, they are indeed necessary. A modern approach to management.</p>

<p>But why people criticize? We all know that the most prominent use of language is to influence others. We all do it in some way or other. Sending 'sms', 'emails', letters, posting links, tweets, blogs, in one form or other are only to influence others, and in this process, making others to realize that we do exist, even only on Social Networking Sites.</p>

<p>Foreground and background can never have same pattern! You may call them 'dissidents', 'assholes', 'some -ist, -ism' or whatever. They would never like status-quo. And whatever significant ever came out in this world, it came out through these guys.</p>

<p>Indeed, Who would not like to live in foreground? This is as tempting as for most of us, money is, power is, peace is, happiness is. They are not much complex. That deserve another blog.</p>

<p>END NOTES:<br/>
1. Irony, though the name of this newspaper is TheHindu, it hated Narandra  Modi in particular and mocked at BJP almost all the time. True, Left  criticism is not there, but for that you can refer to Indian Express. Or  a better picture another estimable newspaper 'The Telegraph' of  Kolkata. When Left loose in Bengal, TOI was so happy deliberately and  quite dumbly says that people had enough of leftism. The picture is to  whom they lost, Mamta who is more opposite to neo-liberal policies. In  fact She represents Leftism in its most darning force but in another  wrapper. But an enemy is lost to a person who has same colors -only more  saturated - and it is time to celebrate.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Once, I used to like 'India Today', not because it was great, just because I was a fanatic BJP supporter and it sounds so right. It claimed that Muslims burned Godhra train (which might be right) and post-Godhra is just, an reaction, mob killing, raping, burning people and then engraving 'OM' on their head. Recently, it turned itself in to a 'semi porn magazine' and of course, one of the biggest force in India which makes 'music out of farts." I do not read this magazine anymore, leave alone reading I don't even buy it but this week issue cached my eye.</p>

<p>Ironically, <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/82472/Cover%20Story/Changing+face+of+rural+India.html">this story</a> appears in the same week in which<a href="http://www.binayaksen.net/"> Binayak Sen </a> was talking on television about hunger and famine on Devil's Advocate and that lunatic Karan Thapar (who rose to prominence by interviewing another lunatic) was doing his best to put words into his mouth, hoping to get the response the way he likes, to prove that he is a Maoist sympathizer - the <em>stuff</em> his audience want to romaticise.</p>

<p>The ironical fact about this story was its cover picture in which some farmers were sitting in the car, wearing clothes so white as to surprise 'tide' detergent, handling mobile phones on the ears, grinning rather than talking, quit conscious about the fact that they are being snapped. Just like channel 4 reality shows which claims that no one is watching in the neighborhood in spite of all the camera-works. Interesting the cars which were in the field had no spot of dirt on them and strangely on which road it could travel to be there in those fields. I have never seen such a wonderful cleaned car even in cities like Mumbai and Delhi.</p>

<p>The opening sentence copied from their website goes, "Forget those images of ravaged villagers, kids with distended bellies and ragged clothes and a future as grim as the cracked, sun-baked earth.<strong> Islands of poverty still exist</strong> but<strong> most of rural India</strong> is transformed beyond imagination thanks to a host of factors which has put <em><strong>unprecedented wealth into the hands of farmers</strong></em> across the country and turned it into a huge consumer market." The only thing was missing was, ofcourse, in background, Rehman song 'Jai Ho'!! But that kind of stuff is not possible in print, even in Hogwarts.</p>

<p>Strangely, lets believe,  <a href="http://indiatogether.org/2010/feb/psa-suicides.htm">all of this has happened, despite of a farmer committing suicide in 30 minutes and 1000 farmers leaving farming a day for last 10 years</a> (as per the government data, which in itself is fraud, but that's a different and very boring story). Perhaps, its easy to believe since BBC reports that some well off Indian farmer bough a SIM card of his favorite number in 20 lacks. Indeed there are countable rich farmers in the state of Haryana, Punjab and western UP.</p>

<p>If this does not happen then why M<a href="http://beta.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/article108458.ece">edia bother to report these ugly guys</a> as if they are, largest consumer of fairness cream.</p>

<p>But it suits well to the people who likes to believe that 'All izz well.." Perhaps that is why Nilekani sees slogan of  '<a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/Slogan-of-bijli-sadak-pani-is-pass-Nilekani/H1-Article1-508691.aspx">bizli, sadak and pani a passe</a>'. Mind you, it was a slogan.. Slogans are not context depended. Or I am being obtuse? Had he been a market champion, a CEO, perhaps we can understand him. But being the one, who is designing the<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/16/india-population-biometric-id-cards"> way we will be identified</a>, we have reasons to be alarmed, not of human rights or civil misuse but the way it can be a tool in the hands of unscrupulous Authority of this great nation who are notorious in robbing us. It not about whether it will be secure for we have no bank account to hold our wealth. And even if we have accountss, how much it would have. (Again reminding you the lame fact that 800 million people in this nation lives below Rs 20 a day.) Already they are denying admission to our children because they do not have birth-certificate. Getting a certificate is so easy. right? Well, this happens in your life also so you can understand. How much we can bribe into your already so fat belly? It can be used to disrobe us from our land for some corporates-house. They can easily say who you are to claim the land? Why don't you have a UID? Why did not you apply online? or by post? (40% people are illiterate, 45% are only word-literate), But the chairman might not get it, there is no one in his team who understand the sociology of villages. But who cares? And you don't want development, you bad ass socialist! Whose development it is? Is it ours. In which SEZ we are given jobs? Or which power plant erected on our land is giving us electricity? It all going into your bellies which is already so fat. You beautiful people! Oh look at your multiple cars parked on the roads, refusing to let people walk and look at you criticizing corruption!</p>

<p>Perhaps, it is interesting look at the cases of Murthy and Nilekani. One has started INFOSYS awards to promote science and education in India. His latest book in not known as well as of Nilekani. One sounds so right to capitalist and other is, ofcourse, is damning piece. Murthy consider himself as a 'compassionate' capitalist. Ha! Compassion in this 'competitive Capitalism'. Compassion is the first victim of competition. Remember the anti-reservation drama. The guys who considered it 'death of the merit' innocently forgot that in 1940's British included the 3rd division, just to pass the natives (who were at that time were Brahmins). Since then the 3rd division is there in India. Perhaps the temporary arrangement are the most permanent in this country. British never had concept of 3rd division. Have you seen it in their Railways (or in ours)? 3rd division is the 'reservation' for Brahmins those days. After that, of course, why would they support otherst. When once's ass is on fire, one protest. Tamilnadu, which have a long history of reservation. Just look at their cut-off marks. In 2005, the difference was of 12 marks in general and ST category (279 and 267). <a href="http://littlemag.com/reservation/index.html">See report on p 124. </a> So we have a middle class who is ruthless when it comes to its own belly feeding.</p>

<p>Let me warn you, "I am a bad ass socialist" who are generally confronted with the argument that they want to make all fingers in the hand equal, and that is lame. True, that will be lame. But even if you believe in this ridiculous idea that society and human hand are same then consider a finger as large as to represent 1.12% who have 80% of the Nation's GDP and more than 80% fingers are as small as Rs 20 a day. Is this hand now look ugly? A middle finger is so large and others are so small. Just try to do that, hide your other fingers and show your middle finger to some guy, its also offensive. Isn't it? <a href="http://openlibrary.org/b/OL2829589M/idea_of_natural_inequality_and_other_essays">Natural Inequality</a> has much more dimensions than a human-hand can have. But that would not edify the generation who thinks and speaks in tweets.</p>

<p>But what about the jobs Capitalism has created in India? Hehe.. <a href="http://www.blogger.com/goog_1266579308470">For last 12 years economy is growing at the pace of 6-8% but the job creation was at the rate of 1.3%. At the same rate at it used to be before. We are not a manufacturing economy like China</a><a href="http://www.neoncarrot.co.uk/h_aboutindia/india_economy_stats.html">. Those figures are from your beloved HT, India TOday, TOI as the link states</a>. Had I put the figures from <a href="http://www.epw.in/">EPW</a>. Oh my god, you leftist! We have a growth without jobs. Thats why you have so many billionaire but 30 million more people going into poverty.</p>

<p>Back to India Today - who claims to speak about Connaught place rather than Old Delhi -  why all these so-called journalists (stenographers) write about us in a way which we are not. May be because a corporate who have stakes in India Today also runs a irri<a href="http://beta.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/article108458.ece">gation-tools company which spends much on advertisement rather on research. Interesting?</a></p>

<p>We were so closed to wipe out malaria in 1990's and then there was free market. Your beloved Manmohanics cut down rural budget. There was no new books in my village-school library. There was no DDT spray in my village anymore, nor were the injections of common diseases to cattle. But there was huge incentives to the citizen who are already so well off. But the Velligens are not to be listen to, unless they kill themselves in large number or some of them kill others who are by the way represents the ugly face of this system if not responsible for their undoing. Yes, I meant the Naxals.</p>

<p><a href="http://beta.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/article108458.ece"></a>In a vast country as in India, you can find enough sample to prove what you like. A few of the farmers must have registered for TATA NANO. A few in India can be a very large number. Could be in lacks. But what about those 80% of all rural population who are net food-buyers. Do you think rising food prices are good for rural-India??</p>

<p>Perhaps the way they have been educated says a lot about these beautiful people. Most of the prominent exams are of A, B, C, D kind. Choose one, you are not allowed to think! These are the only options available You are taught TINA (There Are No Alternatives). Dare you think anything out of ABCD... <a href="http://dilawarsays.blogspot.com/2010/02/tweet-it-down.html">What a tweeting down.</a></p>

<p>So we have all these people,<a href="http://www.blogger.com/goog_1266569758569"> who consider themselves to </a><em><a href="http://www.blogger.com/goog_1266569758569">intellect </a></em><a href="http://dilawarsays.blogspot.com/2009/11/open-letter-to-richeswould-be-riches-of.html">enough to figure out what is good for us and what is bad for us</a>. Never mind if they have ever visited any village in their lifetime. But they have all the degrees from all the corners of the globe. And that give them rights to speaks about a land which they never visited. Once a LSE educated CEO of a prominent Newspaper in Hyderabad arguing that journalist do not have to read and blissfully boasting that he did not read a single book since He left LSE.. <em>Padhe Likhe log!!</em><br/>
<em><br/>
</em><br/>
<em>What say, you <a href="http://books.google.co.in/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=XsOtRGdvIigC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=%22Dumont%22+%22Homo+hierarchicus%22+&amp;ots=g_9cEEiV4L&amp;sig=WCGSFH0srBSha1yWWhxsytuFVxM#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">Homo hierarchicus</a>, hell bent to make this nation a<a href="http://frontline.in/stories/20100226270400400.htm"> survival society</a>. </em>Survival of the fittest or the survival of the fattest. And why survive, when you can live? But this is not an option in your A, B, C, D life. What are you reading? GRE, CAT, GATE, JEE, ........ Reading to survive, thinking to survive, arguing to survive... writing to survive..</p>

<p>I can remain quiet, but its getting harder and harder. Speaking is also not fun but still, its for what we have developed language. First we realized that we can influence others so we build it, Human do politics and there is nothing wrong in it. Everyone do politics. Whether Bhagat Singh, Gandhi, Vivekananda... but of what kind? That is debatable! Primates can not realize that so they did not make a language despite of building all the tools. They have sounds, suffix, prefix etc but not the sentences.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Just try to google "Ideas are like" and wait for suggestions. They could be like rabbits, children, bullets. And if you include you-tube, tweeter and Facebook. Ideas could be anything, just like an idea._<br/>
_</p>

<p>I'd like to add one more. <strong>Ideas are like electrons. </strong> Electrons are notorious for their random velocity with 'zero' displacement over time and do not drift/move in a particular direction untill there is some bias.</p>

<p>You are biased! One often hears it now and then. This is another curious this to say since everyone is biased. Ideas and electron can not move in a direction unless there is bias. Bigger the bias, longer the movement. If a person is super-biased, Like Marx, Gandhi, Vivekananda, Keynes, Wittgenstein etc, ideas behaves like hot-electrons under large bias. A hot electron when collides with crystal (which does not like to change, like society) stresses it, creates secondary electrons, rebounds, sometimes falls into traps and holes and fill neutralise them. Strong Ideas do the same, stresses the society, creates more ideas, rebounds, and sometimes falls in to traps and holes. One thing I like to clarify here that 'charge-carriers' are always of the same polarity. 'Hole' is an absence of electrons. They are myth to make students easily understand the understandable.</p>

<p>Having established it, I'd like to add that Ideas and Electrons can never get annihilated after falling into holes or traps. In traps, they'd create stress. In holes, they'd neutralise it. So other electrons can move forward. One can not hold strong-ideas in oneself, just hot-electron can not be hold at a particular place, even in quantum dot . Or roughly, if your are in CMOS, this is equivalent to say that 'source'(in FET) can not hold electrons when there is bias. Same way, one needs to spit ideas out even when the cost of doing is very high - Socrates drinking poison or Bhagat Singh being hanged. If you want to trap ideas, it will stress you. It will make you made. If you will let them out, society will stress you. No one likes abrupt change. Inertia is the Nature though they say that 'change' is nature. Perhaps this change is to make inertia more permanent. Thermodynamics teaches us the all natural process minimizes energy. Without energy there would be no motion. A complete still. Chaotic yet perfect. <strong>So I refuse to believe that change is nature! Chaos is in nature! A chaos that does not change is nature. Otherwise why every natural phenomenon tries to minimizes energy. This is the ultimate aim of this world. To be at still, to be at peace with no change. </strong></p>

<p>You'd like to argue that energy is constant, even if it is minimised in one phenomenon then it will be added to some other phenomenon. No, energy is not constant. Its mass and energy combined which are constant. Energy will change in to mass, which is by its very nature, has inertia.</p>

<p>But why would this universe, by big-bang or whatever means, started its journey if ultimately it had to be the still again. Why a cycle appears to repeat itself. Answering this could be as mysterious as mystery itself or as simple as the case of simple loop. First you need to believe that there is life, or say consciousness. But ideas in you comes to still; you have no idea at all. Wouldn't your conscious explode? Perhaps the ultimate still-chaos is the most unstable? That indeed is a tough question, why something happens to meet the same end again and again.</p>

<p>Lets come back to our previous case. Bhagat Singh famously said that, "Bomb and pistol do not make revolutions, ideas do..." That seems to be so true, You never see a gun in the hand of the secretary of Maoist. It does not mean that He do not know what to do with it. Their sympathizers also do no carry weapons still they were the first one to get arrested. May be perhaps, Osama Bin Laden posing with gun is only symbolic. He might have not fired it on anyone after he took the prominent position. So ideas are most dangerous. They precedes actions.</p>

<p>Ok, our electron and ideas! There is no similarity between highly charged ideas and charged electrons for electron have a constant charge. But there is a catch. It is the misuse of the words. Charge is something which convey current. <strong>Though their are both positive and negative and annihilates each other after attracting each other but this does not happen in case of ideas. If we assume that ideas are also 'charged' then they must annihilate each others for they are of equal and of opposite nature. BUT NO TWO IDEAS DESTROY EACH OTHER<em>. </em></strong><strong>They may produce other ideas and release some energy as 'debate' after their collision. So we see they can not be differently charged if they are charged. Like electrons they must have a single character of charge. </strong>(By the way, in English language, first it was 'hot' which was hot. Then the word 'sexy' became hot. now its 'cool' which is hot. -- W Saffire, The english Language.)</p>

<p>Ever wonder, why there are some books which are your favorite. Actually your favorite books tell you the same things which you already knew in some way or other.  These books will put these ideas in an impressive order and may use language in a wonderful way to remove your doubts. So if this is true, favorite books are not good books if you want to increase your dictionary of ideas. Read the ideas you hate and your bias will go down, if you want to be least biased. But again if you are not biased then you are at 'zero' potential, others would like to calibrate their bias with respect to you. In other words, "You head will become that much open that your brain might fall out." Its nothing wrong being biased. Neither it is bad to be a 'ground' potential. What is bad is not letting your ideas to be known to this world.</p>

<p>But 'being biased' is considered bad? Expressing yourself might influence others. It might be good or bad to influence others in short time. But this is how knowledge is refined. This is how progress is done in scholarships, and as a aftereffect, ensues progress in society.. Take for instance, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/clever-monkeys/monkeys-and-language/3948/">Primates, they have all the tools to build a language</a>. But still they have not built a significant-language. It is argued that they did not care to develop language for they do not recognize that others have thoughts and they can  influence them. Just wonder, in spite of colossal benefits (yes, they also do politics.).</p>

		<div class="entry"><p><em><strong>[Italics </strong></em><strong>are the notes taken from some other sources.] Not for generalization!!</strong><br/>
<strong><br/>
</strong><br/>
<strong><em>'Sex, Scotch and Scholarship'  written by Khushwant Singh, named (or advertised) in this order, perhaps to indicate that first two will seriously damage the last one. His claims of scholarship however was not undermined by Sex (which probably happened only in His mind, as the case with the most of the Indian Scholars, whether they like to argue otherwise) or Scotch (which He'd take as two 'chota' peg a day) but by another 'S', the lumpen despot, Sanjay Gandhi. Well a lot has been said in this regards. [See, Anthropologist among the Marxist and other essays, By Ramachandra Guha."]</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em><br/>
</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>Perhaps, the partisanship is the most serious challenge which is faced by Indian Scholarship. More serious than 'Sex' and 'Scotch' taken together. It is well known that after 'Hindutva' (the most maligned version of Hinduism ever) forces took office in 1999 in New Delhi, there first attempt to rewrite the history books[1, 2, 3]. <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/saffronisation-education-instruments-strategies-analytical/8185225828-bw23f6jaed">NCERT books were rewritten</a>, so hurriedly that even a newspaper like Hindustan Times could see the anomaly. As argued in 'Ideology and Social Science' by Andre Beteille, Indian scholars did not confront government in a way they should have. In the same time, there was a major reshuffling and new appointments in Archeological Survey of India (ASI) which then busied itself to disseminate and justify the idea of 'Hindutva'. <a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1720/17200040.htm">They even tried to prove that Indus Civilization was indeed a Vedic Civilisation</a>, though facts say otherwise.</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em><br/>
</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>But the idea of Hindutva, no matter how narrow, touch a deep chord in Hindu Intellectuals (as they like call themselves). Perhaps people who were ruled over by foreigners for so long despite of their sheer numbers, like to take solace in these ideas. It makes them more comfortable to blame others for our undoings.</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em><br/>
</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>Indeed, the bankruptcy of our own achievements is so profound in our mind that We all take too much pride in anything popular which is Indian, even if remotely (e.g. Sunita Williams). Amazingly and surprisingly, at the same time, being ignorant to our own scholars/achievers.</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em><br/>
</em></strong><br/>
<strong>_But when It comes to past, our pride in our achievement blind us so much that even the myth and fantasies were believed - as the the rule of thumb - blindly. The believes that We gave this world too much of Mathematics is flawed[1][4]. There is nothing concrete/rigorous mathematics in Vedas or Sanskrit-literature (with some exceptional works of Aryabhatta, I know what I am speaking. I spend a whole semester learning about "Indian Astronomy" in HSS dept IITB as a regular course work). The idea of 'zero' is indeed revolutionary but again after inventing it, We keep adding it to the world. The world, which knows anything about Vedic mathematics is due to Arabic Scholars who gave references to Indian sources, almost generously. </strong>A quality which is raped in our educational institutes every day! <strong>Perhaps we are too soft on corruption. Chalta Hai. And some of us hate those Muslim scholars and believe that all of the 'badness' in Hindu ways of life is brought about by foreign powers.. _</strong><br/>
<strong><em><br/>
</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>There are indeed some nice results by Aryabhatta (who is believed to be first to figure out that earth rotates around the sun though it is still left unproved) and others. But they fell short of anything which could be called rigorous mathematics for they did not give the proofs. </em></strong><br/>
<strong><em><br/>
</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>Why would they not give the proofs? Why make knowledge obscure? What does it speaks about Indian Scholars? Were they envious that others might learn? Whatever are the answers, The doings were perverse.</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em><br/>
</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>Indeed, We developed the most profound grammar of all time. I am proud of it. 'Astadhyayi' as the most scientific studies of language ever. Panini grammar is great. He made Sanskrit so refined and perfect that it came close to being Sanskrit (the perfect). Sanskrit was not standardized that time, one was used for ritual and one was for general talking. There were other dialects too. [4]</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em><br/>
</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>Why would Panini write this grammar at that time? Was he afraid that some more changes might come? Although the most refined Sanskrit was not spoken in His area (It was spoken in the areas now in Punjab and Haryana [4]), he shaped his own dialect.  </em></strong><br/>
<strong><em><br/>
</em></strong><br/>
<strong>_</strong>The amazing fact about it is that the language of Indian Scholarship had never been the language of masses. <strong>First It was Sanskrit, spoken by a few learned,  now it is English, spoken by few (about 3%, including broken English). </strong>Why there was/is not effort to fill this gap?<em><em><strong> </strong>Don't(Didn't) We like to fill this gap? Best way is by translating. Why Indian Scholars do/did not do that? How many scientific journals do you know which translates their work in Indian Language! Why should 97% of Indians not have access to current affairs in Knowledge.<em><strong><br/>
</strong></em> _</em></em><strong><em><br/>
</em></strong><br/>
Power is for power, to rule. Knowledge is nothing less than a power if others are ignorant. In Vedic time it was the source of Brahmin power for He was the only who could interpret Vedas for the masses. They translated a lot of works but they changed the translation for masses to maintain their authority. The 'puranas' are the classic examples of corruption. Even in Mahabharta, it is believed that 'Geeta' was added later, some ideas are so suitable for powerful that over time they have been used to justify some of the worst actions. In Mahabharta, it was used to justify why you should wage a war and 'fare forward' ('fare well' is not necessary). Then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer</a> would invoked it to justify Hiroshima and Nagasaki. <strong>I wonder why Obama did not use it in his Nobel acceptance speech? Fare Forward guys and kill. Every bomb-lover should buy one copy of 'Gita', Surely, (s)he would find solace in it.</strong></p>

<p>****But now, again, why would powerful like to teach others that in fact, there is no evidence that 'Ram Sethu' exists or Rama was born at the same place at that particular time, when they know than they can rise to power by not doing so? Partisanship is in blood of India. The way they are aligning themselves with powerful nations might ashamed Nehru out of his soul.</p>

<p>Shockingly people who blame Indian government for Bhopal disaster (even if on anniversaries) and being soft on US company do not show that much of frustration when  ISRO launches Israel's satellites and India buy arms from them while they keep on killing more and more. They do not even care, why We sell arms to Myanmar while their is a military dictatorship. <em>Perhaps We exchange notes on how to kill people and not let media know it. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/oct/30/mining-india-maoists-green-hunt">We are doing in our tribal heartland</a>, making 'Avatar' the movie everyday.</em> They indeed are powerful. US is mighty, Myanmar is a power market. If you have done something very wrong, take a dip in Ganga and all the 'sins' will be 'zero' then you can start afresh. <strong>That is also an invention by our Scholars.</strong><br/>
<strong><br/>
</strong><br/>
<em>Amartya Sen found it way too hard to explain people in China about tuitions in India at primary classes. Some of my colleagues here in my organisation tell about some professors who gives private tuitions  to engineering students. Would you believe it? (You would if you are from India). Our Schools are concentration camps. </em>Barack Obama likes it. In fact it is indeed very interesting how Indian Education is seen in America. They must be at the brink of Disaster. <em>As Amartya Sen puts it, We have lot of 'first boy' - topper in school - to make other believe that Indian Educational System is great. In India concern with the not-in-merit is very low. Children commit suicide here even after scoring 97%. And the sheer number of our toppers are enough to make a mark in world's Bazaars. Our number are our strength and weakness.</em><br/>
<em><br/>
</em><br/>
In [1], Sen argues about that Indians are of very argumentative. This book is worth reading, there is not a single false claim or fact. <strong>But I still have to meet an Indian who love to argue without getting personal. In fact, I have not met a single Indian who can sustain his/her argument for 5 minutes, leave alone arguing. This is remarkable since Indians are known for their capabilities to speak. We have a world record in speaking at an UN assembly. But that might be that I have not met one. Comment is indeed a thing Indian do but they are mostly either dead plus or dead minus. Check any Indian newspaper, either one is supporting or opposing. A lot of data is there but few informations.</strong><br/>
<strong><br/>
</strong><br/>
In old days Scholarships were patronised by a lot of Indian Kings. Best examples are Karnatka and Kerala. Hindi heartland never held education in high regards, at best it is the a ladder to climb to the success. If you want to hire someone who is good at routine work and would never complain, hire Indians. They do not speak when things are shameful, they only talk when they are proud of something.</p>

<p>Indian scholarships has not found a patron, other than government (with a pleasing exception of Tatas for soem time). Although we have a lot of billionaire, none of them ever tries to maintain a university on the lines of Clay Mathematical Institutes, John Hopkins etc. Infosys Awards are a small steps in this direction. I like Narayan Murthy. Amazingly his books is not as famous as of Nilekani. Why? Perhaps the way He has criticized market and capitalism does not sound well? But he can not be termed some -ist, He made an empire out of these philosophies. <em>People who are suffering with TINA (There Is No Alternative) would not like it.[6]</em> But they are hell bent to argue that Fees should go up in university and public money are not to be wasted. ha! What a good way to waste money! They also insist that university should be more industries oriented. But the success of these industries with that kind of human resources has been too much to agree with them. Universities should be cheep and non-partisan. Cheep so people do not have to work anything for money to repay what they have spent and can spend their time the way they like. <strong>Higher fees suits industries, not scholarship. I do not see how  any pass-out from IIM after spending that much would like to work for rural development. (S)He could have, had the fees been low enough.  </strong></p>

<p><strong>But again as I always like to say, India is a funny place, some times so funny that it becomes exasperating.</strong><br/>

		<div class="entry"><p>A book lover - an old book lover - apparently a scholar, was lashing on the gen-X (or Y... I mean the youngistan)  in my favourite newspaper 'The Hindu (Which takes pride in being slow and steady. Nonetheless it has been the first one to introduce a lot of technologies e.g. color pics, online edition.), "They have 100 rupees for burger but they do not have it for Books." I was slightly amused. Which book will come in for 100 rupees? (Gray market? Yes, If you read pulp fiction.). And there was a marketing clue.</p>

<p>Perhaps, He is not alive to see this day. Apparently after the colossal success of Chetan Bhagat, "5 Point someone", there are now a lot of books in market which would cost you less that 100 rupees - like a Burger. They are cheap, they are indeed tasty and its effect on the health are not to be discussed, like burger.</p>

<p>A book store manager was quoted recently as saying, "See, you need total different marketing strategy for Chetan and Shobha de. [pause] Actually .... to market all the books which are with under Rs 100 tag." May be, he meant supply-demand curve. What you say? Hungry kya?</p>

<p>Apparently, in a time, where there are few wbsites  forcing you to think in tweets, it is not surprising to see these burger-books are marketed as literature. Why not do it if burger can be marketed as diet. Market them well before they goes out of novelty. However, as far as I can see, relationship of book-selves and burger books is no longer that a typical Hollywood relationship (There are fews which last longer. Why? Another curious case!).</p>

<h2>Meanwhile, OUP introduced "A very short introduction to ....." series which by the way cost you somewhere around pizza, like all of paperback editions. But they are not burger or pizza books. They are just lean books. A nice initiative, esp for lay(wo)man, saves time and gives you the best (prominent) of the subject.  </h2>

		<div class="entry"><p>He was just like any other animal walking on His four legs with his head, heart, stomach in same level. All of them were empty. But the emptiness of stomach was only obvious for him for Mind had not evolved in His Brain yet. The only things that motivated him were were his Stomach and his Penis.</p>

<p>Suddenly one day, He stood up on his legs and declare that his Brain takes the most prominent position in His body. He held his Head high, gazing in to the horizon. Curiosity took over him and a little Mind started evolving in His Brain. Though his Stomach did not like it, He did not confront it for they had no ideas to put against it. He never argued but they had a plan to reclaim their authority over Man. He would make some nasty sound whenever It get empty and the Man had to stop thinking and had to start hunting. His Penis had no problem at all. He always knew there is no way Its share in His life is going down.</p>

<p>Amazingly, both of them knew that they have to corrupt the Brain. How they acquire such a knowledge is hard to say. Mind was growing up, they decided they will influence it. Mind will ultimately be the voice of Brain. Why not influence it? But communicating with Mind met with a challenge. First they were far from Brain and the only linker between them and Brain, the Heart, was still empty, not conducive. There was no one who can send their messages to Mind. Brain was so happy seeing the wonders on the top of himself, he did not care whether someone down there planning to corrupt Mind, His avatar - who was so dear to It.</p>

<p>Our two legged animal now felt so different that He declared himself to be totally different from animal and named himself Human. From now on, It was He, the Human, a Man.</p>

<p>But He was not alone. There was She. She was now totally different for Him. Enabled with His brain he could get curious about her. But She was so strange from any thing He had seen till now or He had tried to explore. She was a mystery. A mystery so profound that His Brain could not understand its depth. Or perhaps He was afraid of loosing time from other problems, problems that would make Him very famous. His Brain dumb these mysteries to His Heart in hope to figure them out some other day. Who would worry about her, no one in His circle wants to know about her. She was a personal curiosity not to be discussed in public.</p>

<p>These mysteries likes their new home. His Heart liked them all. Heart was so enchanted with them that for many time its pace would get disturbed. It would beat faster, some times way to fast. Sometimes It was so hard to sleep for Man. The Brain felt that He should come to the rescue of Man but It could not decipher them. To hide Its limited capabilities and embarrassment, It'd declared, "These problems are not solvable for they are not problems at all but FEELINGS, From now on, I'll will not ponder over the matters of this stupid Heart. I have a universe to understand." Since then He is still facing this problem.</p>

<p>His Penis was happy. Now He can claim his authority over Him with the help of some FEELINGS. Only the Stomach was sad for his loss of honor. He was not abasing his head now like animals to fill his Stomach. He was now enjoying smell of rose rather thinking about next meal. What a downfall!!</p>

<p>He was enticed. Some FEELINGS were identified in that era. Like Love, Happiness, Hate, Envy. How? Its hard to say. Mind never took the challenge to try to understand them in public for It was afraid of loosing Its well established position of  'know-it-all'. But in private, It would think about them, only to loose confidence. Oh, the Confidence. So strong was the temptation of not loosing it that it threatened Brain so much not to indulge in such activity, activities which were obscure with no guarantee of success.</p>

<p>Mind and Heart were doing well in their domain for Stomach was in background. Stomach was satisfied for a lot of time so It did not trouble Man. After Mind figure out Agriculture, Stomach authority was reduced to dust. No body was thinking about Him. He was sad. But He saw hope in Heart. Somehow, Heart had won over Mind in many of the ways. No longer Mind came Heart way in many of the matters. Few areas in Man's life were controlled by Heart. Stomach waited for the right time. He was sensing that already A new feeling was born in Heart. May be He can use it. It was named Greed. But the real chance came very late. It came when society evolved. And with it Morality. And with it, limitation on Mind.</p>

<p>Society came to the Man and ask him to do a particular task rather then running around here and there all the time.<br/>
"Why?" Man questioned.</p>

<p>"Don't you see, If we all do particular task and get expert in it, We can produce much more. We all be happy."<br/>
"I am happy!" Man persisted.</p>

<p>"Oh you stupid Man. No you are not happy. No one is happy. Happiness is a pursuit. It can only be strove for, longed for, worked for but It is not to be achieved. Do not live in 'maya'. Look at your kids. They are half naked and trembling in cold. Look at your wife, She works so hard for so little. We all to have work so less and We'll get so much. You are so intelligent. We'll find you a better work than other. More materials is what is the essential part. We should consume more. This is better. You ought to do better works."</p>

<p>"What is a better work?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see. In which you have to do less labor. Less labor is  'intellectual'. All you have to do to think and solve the problems for which others do not have the capabilities. The life of contemplation so others can live a life of actions. Yes, you need to tell others about what actions are good or bad."</p>

<p>His Mind loved it. It convinced him that yes indeed 'division of labour' is a good idea. "But What will I eat if I do not do labor in My farm."</p>

<p>"We have a guy who has solved this problem, in fact He is with us. He speak a language which We have trouble understanding.. He is like a magician. In fact, He has invisible hands. He ought to be right. May be you should talk to him and explain to us what He exactly means."</p>

<p>"Whats your name? " Asked the man to this weired looking guy.</p>

<p>"Market. I am Market."</p>

<p>Greed and Stomach were talking to each other with a mysterious look.</p>

<p>Man and Market talked about this new order for a long time. Man noticed that this Market does not have invisible hands. In fact, There was no hand at all. Market looked at him with a scorn and smile and said, "I should tell you the things as they are. I must be honest with you for without you I have no future and without me you will suffer. I do not like Hands. They represents Labour and I hate Labour. Think Man think, You are the most Intelligent person here. See how much power we both can have if you allow to be take over this world."<br/>
"Power", Man thought.<br/>
"I will make sure that your children will get all the benefits even if they are not as intelligent as you are. I'll maintain prosperity in your hierarchy. Are you thinking of exposing me? Do not even consider that. Then you will have to live like a laborer and my time is coming, you like it or not. And I hate laborers. In my time, they are going to pay for doing labour. What you think? Think about your family, your children, your status in society. Besides you will have so much time to think and a lot of authority!! Power, my friend, power...."</p>

<p>His Mind, Brain, Stomach were all convinced. The Penis was thinking if It can find a fortune in this new establishment. He and Lust were exchanging glances.</p>

<p>"Look", says Market. "We will talk about theory of Market now. Like I have invisible hands"</p>

<p>"But this is a myth", Man <em>ventured</em>. He has started understanding His language.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, It is a myth. The the danger is people will criticize it. But I call it Theory. Myth are allowed to be challenged, Every one is allowed to have one version of it or another. Theories are not to be criticized. No one would challenge it."</p>

<p>"Do you think no one will challenge it."</p>

<p>"Oh you and your curiosity. Some will, but I have found a way out of it. See in my hand this shiny thing, This is Money. I'll reward those who will fall in line. They are never going to argue about my authority."</p>

<p>"This piece of Metal, Do you thing for this Man will give his soul to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, you know  so little about you. Do you like to be my partner or not? I'll explain other things to you later. For now, We need to convince the society or perhaps We should confuse them."</p>

<p>"We are going to bring DEVELOPMENT", said the Man to the society. "There might be some creative destruction, Some of you will have to suffer but your children will be better off. A new order is coming. In which all Man will be equal, Some will be more equal and Few will be much equal, Rest will be working with Market. But after all, All Man will be equal. Market is here for our salvation for we are so poor. Lets work together for better Future"</p>

<p>Few were skeptics but they though they could not understand Him. He was always mysterious in good way. He was scholar also for He had discovered fire. He can not be wrong. They trusted Him.  But 'better future' filled their heart with the most strong feeling ever, The Hope.</p>

<p>And that day, Stomach knew Its time has come!</p>

<p>Over the time, Stomach had  reclaimed his lost authority. In fact, He never felt so strong. His heart was giving space to those feelings who were in sync with the interest of stomach. His mind is tackling problems which will make His stomach fatter. His Penis is busy exploring all the hidden prosperity for itself. Indeed, It is the most happy in those days.</p>

<h2>But the Market kept all the promises He made to Man. And still His Hands are still believed to be invisible.  </h2>

		<div class="entry"><p>When was the last time you shook your thing", I asked one of my friend who was apparently in love. Then there was high-fives and jokes all around. He told it's been 20 days. Roughly the time since He saw her. I was amused so was everyone inside the room. Masturbation and love have two extremly opposite school of thoughts. Ones goes like this, "Mastrubation is like having sex with someone you love." That is surely not the case here with our friend. In one of my most beloved literally work, "My Name is Red" by Orhan Pamuk, the protagonist Kara (Black in english translation) was in love. How he discovered that? When he could not mastrubate after having a thought of her.</p>

<p>P<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/r407h39183426645/">erhaps the idea is different in different society with temporal paradox</a>. India, paradoxically, have been quite sane on the matter of sex (including masturbation). For west, it had been quite a hot potato to handle even in thse days. In West, if for some, it is "like having sex with someone you love." For some in East, it's a conviction that they are in love; emanating from the fact that they can not do it after having a though of her (him?). For some it might be mechanical process, no need of fantasies (I used to be like that in my teenage). That is kind of cold! But more a less, it has been a taboo to talk about or may be to think about also. May be that is why so much confusion is still there, even among those who can read and write. Otherwise why would '<em>gupt rogi mile'</em> kind of advertisement for treatment of '<em>hasta methun' </em>(masturbation) (which, by the way, is not a disease) is flourishing in India (what about your nation?)?</p>

<p>Once in my diary I wrote that the job you are doing should be like masturbating. You are excited by the thought of it. Prepared, enjoying while doing it. And when it is done you are relaxed and ready for another after some time. But how much energy is needed to live like that? Never calculated, even roughly, how much energy is needed to maintain that rapid changes in state machine of mind and body? It must be pretty large.</p>

<p>I'd love to argue in support of seeing the ability of mastrubating as an indication of whether you are in love or not. It might be good confusion remover. Wouldn't it? Anyway next time to settle to do it, give it a thought.</p>

<h2>UPDATE : In U.S., the candidate who won election in 2010 (yes, this modern age) thinks among many other things that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/15/christine-odonnell-delaware-midterms">masturbation is sin</a>.   </h2>

		<div class="entry"><p>India is a funny land, I always like to argue. In fact so funny that sometimes it seems to be exasperating. When it comes to irony, nothing matches India. This is a land where temporary arrangements are most permanent (reservation, schedule 9 etc). This is also a land which have a rising economy 8-10% though creating jobs at 1%. It has second most number of billionaire still 80% of her population lives below Rs 20 a day. The most global city of her is in news in for localisms and blah blah...</p>

<p>But that is not what I meant to write today. I keep an eye on gender issues, mostly in India. The position of women is India is also ironical. Sometimes they are worshiped as goddess, and most of time otherwise. The <a href="http://www.thp.org/where_we_work/south_asia/india/research_reports/chronic_hunger_and_status_of_women">current gender inequality and hunger in India</a> is a matter of concern for every public spirited Indian.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.littlemag.com/pdf/contents-venusenvy.pdf">Lets get to the point</a>. In hindu religion, there are lot of goddess (devi). Prominent are three. But they are not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Goddess">central deity</a>. In spite of their power, knowledge and wealth, they had been married (or denied individuality in letter and spirit) to the three gods, the trinity. <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/god-woman-merlin-stone/015696158x-apw3fnvhfe">Not in Vedas, but later after Vedanta</a>.  Perhaps, that did not serve the purpose of<em> <a href="http://hinduism.about.com/library/weekly/aa051303a.htm">Manuvadi</a></em>. A fearsome, uncontrolled <em>devi</em> were to be a <em>biwi, </em>an uncontrolled power had to be subjugated. They made a morality out of it.<a href="http://www.svabhinava.org/Dialogues/SarasvatiUnicorn/index.php"> Indus civilization has some sort of central deity</a>. Since Indus script is still un-deciphered its hard to say exactly how these deity were treated, whether they were total independent or considered as 'the other half'.</p>

<h2>Perhaps world could have been better off in gender-equality if the deity were left only <em>devi </em>and the the status of <em>Biwi</em> could be an additional one . One should be attached with the least number to identities. It makes life harder to create an identity for oneself otherwise.  </h2>

		<div class="entry"><p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2005/sep/19/ideas.g2">Some views are so bad that they are not even wrong</a>! Few scientists or great men  (unless they were Indians)* enjoyed success in their lifetime. Likes of Galois, Abel, Bool, Fourier and many more are not alive to see their work (mostly criticized in their time) influencing this world. One could live with that! What is unbelievable is how 'lesser-mortals' write, speak and talk about so-assumed 'smarter-than-us' these days.</p>

<p>Strangely almost all of these larger-than-life figures considered themselves as smart as a normal human but the normal human is addicted to see them otherwise. Perhaps that is the only different element they had which made them realize that for doing great things you need not to be gifted with ultimate brain (Is anyone gifted?). Most of the 'so-assumed' best brains were scolded in their schooldays. And how many toppers you know who have done anything significant in the world of knowledge? It is a curse, hard to put yourself together almost all of the time. Trust me!</p>

<p>What is so wrong making a man/woman mentally untouchable. The very reason you worship someone is that you consider them to be much superior than yourselves. Almost impossible to equal. Gautam Buddha starts Buddhism. It started in India and then spread throughout Asia. It was <em>patronized</em> and disseminated by the mighty Indian King Asoka. It had captured almost all of the India that time. Remarkable Buddhism is no longer a prominent religion in India. How come this <em>ethical cleansing </em>happened without shedding a drop of blood?</p>

<p>Nagarjuna started <em>mahanaya</em> branch of Buddhism. Buddha always considered himself a man. He also demanded from his followers that He ought to be considered a man. Alas, Nagarjuna made him 'god'. Now a learned man become a 'god'. An untouchable! In India, individual worshiping is prominent disease. People must have liked the idea of considered him a god for they no longer have to try to become like Him. They do not have to even think about becoming like him. Had Nagarjuna (A brahmin) not done this We might have a more Buddha. Praise and make them untouchables. 'Praise and Rule' is as effective as 'Divide and Rule' only the former has more 'ahimsa' than the letter. That is how Brahmins killed Buddhism in India.</p>

<p>So what makes a Mathematician a Mathematician. How they got that way? Consider yourself doing numbers all the time, addicted with numbers all your life. You are number, when you sleep, eat, breathe or otherwise. You never miss a chance to do some calculation when you had a piece of paper and a pencil. That is what makes a Ramanujan. You want to know everything about electron, consider yourself an electron and live like it.</p>

<p>Lets take most cherished scientist of all time, Einstein. Perhaps He gives the best arguments why he was just an ordinary guy, no no, why he was just a guy with normal IQ (If IQ does exists!). @ <a href="http://rescomp.stanford.edu/%7Echeshire/EinsteinQuotes.html">http://rescomp.stanford.edu/~cheshire/EinsteinQuotes.html</a> They have put up all of his important quotes but they missed what He loved to say. <em>"I solved this problem because I stayed with it longer." </em>How ordinary and simple. He was intelligent with a brain just like yours and mine or anyone else. These people who capitalize on making people superman ignores all the things they have done or said what made then just like us. He might be the brightest in Physics but he considered the 'tax-problem' hardest for him. Even a clerk in the bank will take pride in that.</p>

<p>Guass may be the most intelligent mathematician ever but consider his obsession with math when the news of his wife dying reached to him and He asked that person to tell her to wait since he was in the middle of a problem. If you are that addicted with something, you can simply see it black and white. You have to give up some functions of your brain to make others prominent. If you are programmer, one thread must take the precedence over other threads if you want to make it to handle the most critical part of your program/life.</p>

<p>But what makes them do all these wonderful things. Nothing. If you don't have the habit of grading the works. If you consider work of farmers, engineers, doctors, soldier, rickshaw puller, .. same in some way or other then almost all of us are Einstein, Guass or Ramanujan in some way or other. A auto-driver can be as smart with streets as W. Tutte was with graphs. A farmer may be as knowledgeable about his crop as Warren Buffet with stock market. A mother could be as great anthropologist as<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Burnett_Tylor"> E.B. Taylor</a> or <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/fline/fl1626/16261120.htm">M.N. Srinivas</a>. Nonetheless, they might find it hard to formalize their thoughts to make a publication. It might be a restriction by language/life-style not by intellect.</p>

<p>I find it hard to convince myself of any reason (except a fatal accident) which can be a reason for a person who is hell bent on solving a problem to fail.</p>

<p>Jawahar Lal Nehru (Father of modern India) sums it up best, "<em>We are small people serving a great cause, since the cause is so great some of the greatness will fall on us too."</em> Alas, none of his biographies (Save wonderful <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/br/2007/06/19/stories/2007061950371400.htm">R Guha's India after Gandhi</a>)  starts with this quote (Do you know one?)!!</p>

<p>Don't make us believe that there are few great brains which were different from us! We, Indians have a philosophy which is being lost over the generations. It is '<em><a href="http://www.lyricsmania.com/aham_brahmasmi_lyrics_rudra.html">aham brahmashmi</a>" </em>i.e. I, Myself, is Brahma (the creator of this universe).</p>

<hr />

<ul>
<li>Indians either get success (defined in popular way) in their lifetime or do not get it all. Later, after their death, either they are forgotten or worse were made a villain out of them. Just do a case study on Nehru. A dialogue in one of my favorite movie 'Dark Knight' goes like this,<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/quotes"> "You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain"</a>. In Nehru case (or may be in a lot other cases too) would go like this, "You live like a hero, and remembered like a Villain for the almost all of the Indians (the average Indian) is amnesic." Worse they burn their dead and forget them. Ever wonder why the states of India (larger than most of the European countries) do not have their history well written in a any way. If you meet any citizen of India ask him/her about his/her family tree. At best (s)he will tell you about only 2 or 3 generation that will mostly include male members name! Worse, If somehow you meet a Villagen of India, 99.9% will not able to tell you their 'date of birth' (read Death or Birth).</li>

		<div class="entry"><p>, This century started with the fears of Y2K problem about which in my class, some guys - whoever had some familiarity with computer, including myself - never got tired prophesying about. "A great doom lie ahead!", I'd declare. I was bit happy with the idea of witnessing something so colossal. As the first morning appears in 2000, there was a pleasing announcement in 'Samachar Prabhat' (Moring News) by All India Radio that the problem somehow did not appear. I was bit amazed and surprised. I did not like things happening this way. May be AIR got it wrong with all the time difference around the world. I had to wait till 8:30pm till 'BBC Hindi Seva' announces that there was nothing happened as predicted. What an start of this decade with a propaganda! The Lie and most importantly people were believing it blindly and forgetting about it just after few day. However some claimed that this problem will emerge in Feb 29, 2000. I waited but no one on Radio took the trouble to inform me on the same day.</p>

<p>This decade had been a decade of naughties as far as Paul Krugman and some Guardian "Free Comments" are considered. People occupied themselves with all the financial collapse and all the shamelessness of Wall Street guys but was not as occupied with Gaza and Iraq/Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Anyway, in my motherland few interesting happened in this decade. First of all, I post-graduated with a degree about which I am quite numb. Second, We have seen common people loosing their definitions. A common Indian no longer lives in villages. It is now english-speaking-upper-middle-class-brown-skin guy who has the habit of 'work by day' and 'party at night'. The real Indians are forgotten. Its none of their fault since they do not form a part of market. But a good thing happened in popular culture. <a href="http://beta.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/Harsh_Mander/article80638.ece">It was return of idealism and real english-speaking-professional-upper-middle-class guys</a>. 'Rocket Singh', "3-Idiots", "Delhi-6", "Paa" were the movies which signifies this peculiar behavior in Bollywood. A real nice thing to be happening around.</p>

<p>In past, we also had a lot more idealist movies than we have now. 'Rocket Singh' and 'Satyakam' are so same yet so different. In one, where the life of staunch idealist protagonist turned sour and was forced in destitute with his family, the philosophical factor is prominent than real one. In 'Rocket Singh', its the corrupt guys who bite the dust at last. Which is more real. May be Satyakam is more real but Rocket Singh is heartening.<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/jan/11/mawkish-maybe-avatar-profound-important"> Its like comparing Avatar with The Road.</a> Satyakam is with values, Rocket Singh is with reality with fun-factor. One is as depressing as other is hilarious.</p>

<p>A kind of situation is between "Mother India" and "Slumdog Millionaire". If you ask me, "Slumdog.. is a perverse movie." It may be real. It may be successful. But it strip off the basic dignity from the people It so piously claimed to speak for. On the other hand you never have a low moment in "Mother India". Its a story, like a story of "A girl with basket" on Allahabad platform who refuse to take money from the author out of self respect. The story is of partition time. When author come to visit India. The girl was selling basket. She wanted to sell them author also who had his hands full since he has bought a lot of stuff. He put some money on the palm of that girl out of sympathy who returned it back with a smile. Few stories, whether real or imaginary, are life-shaping.</p>

<p>Another thing which has changed in this decade is how people are advertising. No longer Dipoka Ji extolling the virtue of a washing soap. No longer a woman body is being used to sell a car. These days they are selling lifestyle. They are selling ideas and philosophy. Abhishek, is no longer selling "Idea" connections. He is selling the idea of using more mobile. They are making fraternity. Some MNC are using Gandhi to sell their pen. Ironical! Since He was the biggest supporter of Swadeshi. Irfan Khan is no longer using security of insurance to sell them, He is using fear and insecurity of life to sell them. Should We consumer let it happen?</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>When I was a kid, I was a fan of '<a href="http://www.allindiaradio.org/vb.html">Vividh Bharati</a>'. This radio station transmits its programs from Mumbai. It is under 'Prasar Bharti'. Every day, from 8:30 pm to 8:45 pm, they used to broadcast a 12-15 minute drama called '<em>Jhalki</em>' just before the 'Samachar Sandhya (evening news).'</p>

<p>"Chottu" was one of those 'Jhalki' which I'd never forget. <em>Chottu </em>means 'little one' in English. <em>Jhalki </em>means 'a glimpse' literally, but it stands for 'a small drama on radio'.</p>

<p>"I do not have any problem with this name", said the protagonist on the radio, "I hate what it stand for." He meant child labor. Child labor in India is very big problem. Indians, both as a society and as a government are indifferent to this problem though they seem to worry about it a lot. A new law has been passed recently banning all forms of child-labor. Quite interestingly, one of the contributor in forming this law is an economist who wrote in New York Times titled “The Poor Need Child Labour” (November 29, 1994). Where he admitted to having had a 13-year-old work in his home. (And who also favoured the decontrolling of fuel prices — to tackle the price rise, no less. And perhaps to help child labour, too?)</p>

<p>If we consider, according to this law, what constitute child labor then almost all of us had done child-labor at some time or other. I am a farmer son. Though my father never took me to fields at the expense of school (unlike most of us farmer's children) but I never had my Sundays and holidays spared. I, along with my brothers, had to work in fields. We considered it daily routine. The idea of labor, in this sense, was not that developed in us that time.</p>

<p>This J_halki <em>was about a kid named </em>Chottu <em>who met the protagonist of this </em>jhalki<em> in train selling peanuts. Everyone was calling him by the name of </em>Chottu<em> (the little one) without bothering anything else about him. He was reduced to a </em>Chottu<em>. In India, If you are a child and on the street selling things (a sight on Indian roads as common as the-great-spit of North India, no pun intended), </em>Chottu_ is what you are supposed to be called.</p>

<p>Any public-spirited Indian will tell you how ugly this problem is. However, everyone is convinced that problem is way to complicated to be solved by some law only. True!</p>

<p>Well, how many Chottu do you know? I have seen many. The kid who brings lunches to my office. The kid who sells <em>chai</em> outside the office. The paratha-maker. The corn seller. The one who is delivering newspaper. How many of those you have employed? Its not a crime if you ask me to give someone job in need. Do they have other options? I don't think so. But should We, whose lives are much easier, not be concerned about their wellbeing? The point is how many children We have exploited for our benefits? At whose cost, we are letting it happen? Shouldn't it the responsibility of a self-respecting society to take care of its children? If no, then it not a responsibility of these <em>chottu</em> to take care of society, to consider our well being when they have the capabilities of hurting us for their benefits as we are doing now.</p>

<p>But what'd you do after taking away labor from Chottu? Have you consider a home for them before striping them from their footpath? Have you helped building a school for them before throwing them out of their current job? Do you have any alternatives? Or it is just fashionable to bar child-labor? Or you do  not like the idea that this rising tiger-economy can have child labor? Lets make them someone else but Chottu.</p>

<p>Rather, it creates more problem than solving it. US barred the carpet import from Bangladesh on the ground that these guys use child labour. What happened, there was a increase in the child-prostitutions. Everyone needs to eat. Hunger is much worse than slavery.  Do you have any solutions how to solve this problem? I dont!</p>

<p>Let me tell you some stories of Chottu. No it'd be worthless. These stories have been told all along. Almost all of them say the same thing (Or maybe my heart can not feel what it should feel). There is no escape from it till economy is not revived and the education is expanded at much higher pace. It's the public sympathy which is need-of-time to confront this problem.</p>

<p>Can We have  a child-labor free India? At the most optimistic level, I can say, "May be if and only if all of Indian feel that yes, it is a problem, else this thing will continue as it is." Great things happen slowly in nature. It is to be solved by evolution not by revolution.</p>

<p>Till, we can ask them what is their name and call them by that. One must allow the basic dignity to a person one seems to care about.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>I am in acquaintanceship with this class for last 8 years and probably will be in the same situation for rest of my life for almost all the institutes, places of scholarships, industries, livable places are abundant of this class. This class, after the independence, has grown in size and influence to an extent that all the India is now captured by it. By its sheer size of over 100 million by any reckoning, it is way to large to ignore and much harder to confront.</p>

<p>Indian Middle class can be judged by the peculiar behavior of its. Though it is very sympathetic (whether morally or genetically) toward growing inequalities in India but very fierce and ruthless in advancing itself for its own benefits at the cost of other less fortunate. It's already in better place and have a strong hold on the resources which makes its life fairly easier than the others in competition. Competitions, even though fair, does not create equal opportunity for all. In India, these are not fair by any standard. Almost all the eloquent supporter of competition belong to this class. However, who scorns at the idea of merit and competitions does not explain how will these institutes function if the practice of merit/discrimination are not to be brought in. The admission criteria can be relaxed to accommodate someone less meritorious in the interest of the civil society at some cost of the Institutes but not at any cost. The reservation in India and the <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S26/34/81K42/index.xml?section=featured">affirmative-action</a> in US (i.e. to admit lesser represented social group, say Black community), both seek to make the representation more diverse (as argued by the politicians that time). However it is really interesting to note that while in US the idea was mooted by the institutes themselves, but in India, it was, at best, forced by politicians. Even Indian politician could have not done that unless the idea of reservation does not touch some chords in middle class. After Mandal, the idea of giving numerical reservation has solidify the caste-hierarchy rather than liquefying it. On bringing a change by themselves, Indian University fail miserably. A very few of them might have taken a new initiative by themselves. At best either they carry out what government tells them or try to find the a way around. Of course if you are not bringing changes someone else will. And others might not be considerate of your interests. Its pity that Indian intelligentsia show indifference toward most of the political matters. It says something about middle class for all the member of these institutes belong to this class. Is this class always wait for an order to do something and only act on whether to follow it or find a way around ?</p>

<p>The other significant Institute is Indian civil services. There are many examples in newspaper in which an individual civil servant talks in a way like all the fault is with the Institute he is serving and (s)he is a different pattern. Should one glorify oneself at the cost of the institute one is serving? This is largely true with the Police and our academic Institutes - both the teachers and students. A pleasing and somewhat peculiar exception is defense forces. I had some good conversation with and ex-Lt. Col. of Indian Army about this aspect. He also like to talk a lot while working in his garden.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Indian Medical Association was opposing the government move to bring more doctors to the rural areas see . When something has the potential to conflict its interest, this class uses all the conventional wisdom more passionately deliberately ignoring the benefits it could bring to other-class (poor workers and peasants). Passion is generally used to hide the weakness of the argument. Indian scholars have the habit of invoking passions while making a point.</p>

<p>In spite of all this, there are significant number of NGOs which work for the most backward of the class, mostly owned by the retired civil servant who are generally believed to be corrupt (at least in Hindi land).Some of these NGOs are doing extremely well. There are some human-rights organization run by retired lawyers and police officers.</p>

<p>It is rather surprising to see that the intellectual belonging to this class has diagonally opposite views. Some are varied of growing inequalities at the same time some the ruthlessly pursuing free-market agenda. Some are in support of sending army to hunt the Naxals down while others the being sympathetic to them. Some are on the panel-discussion on India Tv and while others are taking part on the Lok-sabha Tv. Some are leaving their homeland for greener pasture at the same time others are coming back to help it (or to make some news in media for a while and again to go back). I have known some professors who generally believe that one should work for their own universities and is not good for an Indian to leave the shore for education while at the same time they are comfortable sending their children to these exclusive institutes. And not to forget our educated classmates/students who generally find it hard to believe that there is a caste discrimination (read any story in TOI during anti-reservation campaign) yet follow the same pattern for marriage which their parents have sought.</p>

<p>It's wonderful place to be curious!!</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>How come only Bengalis (and some part of the North East) love foot-ball while rest of the India does not?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2004/06/27/soccer_sociology?pg=full">And all of the America hates it</a>!!!!!</p>

<p>Football is probably the only team-game which is inclusive, and way too damocratic. Everyone contribution is way too important. Most of the other team-games relies on individual efforts. Our beloved, cricket also falls in same category. The performance of the team is solely (or mostly) judged by the statistics of the prominent players. The team success, as a unit, is highly correlated with the individual performance. Any Indian, a cricket-lover, would love to make the point that if this batsman is in form and in team, chances of the winning his team is much more than if that batsman is not in form and is in team. According to him, a single good batsman absence can play havoc on the chances of his team. My experience in cricket insinuates that this indeed is the case in most of the cases. Not recently, Indian used to switch off the television if Sachin got out. Sycophancy comes easily to Indians and so is individual-worshiping.</p>

<p>But how come bengali are so obsessed? For sure, I have no idea!</p>

<p>In 1911 when Mohan Bagan defeated Yorkshire in soccer. And following things happened,<br/>
1. All players, save one, were playing barefoot. The only player was in shoes, probably making his point that He is not averse to adopt western technology.<br/>
2. In the growing phase of Muslim league and the increasing romance with the idea of Pakistan, It was significant that the joy was shared by both Muslim and Hindus alike.<br/>
3. The partition of Bengal was annulled.<br/>
4. The capital of India was shifted from 'Kolkata' to 'Delhi'.</p>

<p>Too much for a win!!!</p>

<p>A officer of very high rank in colonial India once described 'Bengalies' as a 'non-martial race'. A race 'with the wisdom of Greeks but grit of the rabbit'. But the soccer-champions and the gun-wielding Subhash Chandra Bose had taken a toll on their belief and this brought some  sort of vindication in Bengali <em>bhadralok.</em></p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.popmatters.com/books/reviews/h/how-soccer-explains-the-world.shtml">You make out of it what you like</a>. Lets get to the other soccer-hating country. The USA.</p>

<p>_ _<br/>
Soccer is at bottom in US. In a land where, 'winner take all' and 'Me, myself', and capitalism is the widespread diseases, No wonder that Golf, Tennis, Formula 1 etc takes the prominent position. Yes, of course, there is NBA, which is a team game. But if a club XYZ and won than it is sure that Mr. ABC must have score 40. Another praise for individual effort. In soccer, in real spirit, every one is given equal credit for the goal. The midfielder is as important as the striker. However, in countries like USA, they give more credit to striker than the midfielder. Thats also shows the mentality that the person who seems to do the work is more important that the person behind it. No wonder, i-pod is the creation of Steve Jobs rather that its chief-designer/engineer. The managers in USA are those who takes decision about which technology is to be used and how a product to be built rather than the technical team. Anyway, Lets leave these loose statement asides. This madness is gripping India tightly, which has enough uncured diseases from the past like tutelage of women and cast-divide. Any Indian, who likes to make the point, that it's "Me and myself" world and 'make money and move-on' does not sound convincing even to himself/herself for at least he also wants praise from others. There are some remarkable and funny things about Indians. The most seclusive Indian is least-secretive. Its the generally social-Indian has the habit to make a secret out of the trivial things. The urban class, though show much sympathy to villages but somehow seems to be very reluctant for their company even for the one which looks like them. Though they are worst writer (yes, I am an Indian) they can speak for a long time, and apparently, without much use of the mind while their counterpart in Japan finds it really hard even to deliver a political speech for 5 minutes. And when they are in foreign land, they show a remarkable love for things that are Indians, even for their native-language.</p>

<p>And in the most prominent religion, Hinduism, the field-view and the book-view can give a sleepless life for a curious theologists.</p>

<p>Oops, back to football. Of course there is football in USA, they've given it another name. But if you have seen it, (even in Disney Goofy cartoons, "How to play football') you might have noticed that the <a href="http://mondediplo.com/openpage/us-twin-pursuits-of-violence">level of violence in this game</a> may only appeal to a nation who had killed the largest number of civilians (from Hiroshima to Iraq, Never mind that they had won the largest number of Nobel Peace Prizes also). The soccer seems to the game for sissies if you compare it with Rugby/American Football.</p>

<p>The football is epitome of socialism. American football is travesty of it. The quarter-back is like a general of an army who has to be followed blindly. Others are just road-roller.</p>

<p>All most all of the prominent Marxist, Socialist loved soccer. Marx played it, Lenin liked it. The Latin America is crazy about it. In Africa, it is nothing less than Nirvana in their lives.</p>

<p>The eleven American who play this game, or the 1100 who fly with their team to watch them play or the 11000 who watches them on their TV set (which is aired in spanish, mostly, if I am not wrong), they are political dissidents. There is hope for socialism in US till football is there.</p>

<p>And there is hope in this world that Humanity is there in its most pristine form till there is someone out their who loves football.</p>

<p>PS : An article also appeared after first semifinal of FIFA 2010 in guardian newspaper. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jul/06/footballs-debt-socialism-world-cup">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jul/06/footballs-debt-socialism-world-cup</a></p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Somehow, even being trained as an engineer, I could appreciate something in science!</p>

<p>It all begin in my childhood in a same way It begins in every Indians childhood. The pretty stories about science and the wonder of its. But you have to grow up to depreciate <em>this </em>science which has taken roots in <em>folklores</em>.</p>

<p>In our most reputed university, by common consent, Indian Institute of Science, there is a Center for Sustainable Technologies, known as ASTRA (Application of Science and Technologies for Rural Area). It is a curious irony that the abbreviation came out be of destructive meaning! One institute in India which is now in news for all the wrong reasons these days is "Department of Atomic Energy" established in India by Homi Bhabha with the extraordinary support of Nehru. I am going to talk about two scientist, one is physicist and other is a chemist. Both were Banglorian, fellow alma-matters of London. Both of our men, physicists and the Chemists, had the deep and enduring commitment to their homeland. He went to study abroad when the our university were fledgling and came back after earning their degree. Neither of them had to wait to listen to <em>"ye jo desh hai tera"</em> or had to watch the more illustrious and longer version of this song, the movie, "<em>Swadesh" </em>for realizing what is better for them. Whether they should build their own institutes or market themselves in the bazaars of West?</p>

<p>Well, they came back and yet trod on the diagonally opposite paths. One went to produce bombs in the disguise of making atomic energy (DAE has achieved 10% of atomic energy what Bhabha had promised!) other went to make technology for masses while naming his center after a <em>thing</em> which is well qualified for the synonym of destruction.While one of them devoted his life to the greater cause for glorifying Indian state, other chose to bend it to the service of the Indian Villager - those damn-ugly trouble-making lesser mortals.</p>

<p>Another center with more-or-less same values is in IIT bombay which, curiously and interestingly has the pleasing name "CITARA". A dim and twinkling but still a star.</p>

<p>But how come only one of them could become our hero? Yes, I am talking about Raja Ramana. He is known in India as the father of Indian Nuclear program and respected in Pakistan for preventing nuclear war. Our chemists is however known as AKN Reddy. Once he was documented by someone to remark, "<em>Developing countries must not and will not allow themselves to be    distracted from the imperatives of economic development and growth by    the illusory dream of an atmosphere free from smoke or a landscape    innocent of chimney stacks."</em> Meanwhile some prominent voices in the West were boasting, <em>"Smoke is an indication of work . . . therefore, we    are proud of our smoke." [<a href="http://www.vagabondjourney.com/90-in-09-industrialization-india.shtml">http://www.vagabondjourney.com/90-in-09-industrialization-india.shtml</a>]. </em>Now I don't want to comment about Copenhagen!<br/>
<em><br/>
</em><br/>
Anyway, coming forward to my time, We are hearing a lot of Nuclear Energy. Pacts signed by India and US, India and France, India and Russia. Some to supply reactors, others to supply fuel. The assessments of this trade had been done only by DAE or the vulgar cheerleaders of bombs. DAE, being the most secretive organization in India is hard to trust. I go along with the simple notion, "If something is not accountable and transparent it could be anything but science." I forgot who coined this line! Anyway, our cheerleaders who are generally known the euphemism 'Defense Expert' write in almost all of our Newpapers, more or less repeating the same lines, "BUILD BOMBS, LARGER BOMBS, BETTER BOMBS, GOOD BOMBS, PATRIOT BOMBS, SMART BOMBS, ......." They never wield a gun but somehow, in the most active corner of their intellect, seem to be thinking about how to kill fellow humans. They tell to tax-payers, "This is the price you have to pay for your security." While the <em>dushman</em> of the nation can create havoc with their second world war kind of weapons.. Even in US, their tactics were of pre-Nuke times. Too much to spend on this never-to-be-used technology, and worse if ever-to-be-used and no-one-is-left-to-remember consequences. Ha! Are you kidding, they can not be that destructive! Writing in<a href="http://indiatogether/"> indiatogether.org </a>Ramachandra Guha insinuates that DAE is well qualified for a moral and financial scandal which can put Bofors and our petty politicians in shades! Ha, too much for our beloved BARC, which hosts best of our intelligent brains who are yet to figure out why two students were charred to death in one of his laboratory. Its time DAE starts producing its own X-Files.</p>

<p>APJ Kalam is well known but who knows Laurie Baker, a Keralite, an architecture who saved crores of rupees by his artful designs. Fortunately He has an article about him on Wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Baker">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Baker</a>, while out chemist is not known even on Wiki. Probably Bakers, British-born tag! What you say? Brown skin.. rubbing fair-and-handsome on your hated-skin!! Are you worth it too?</p>

<p>On this new year, lets explore other possibilities.. That serving our own motherland could be as rewarding in some sense as selling ourselves in Western bazaars (Yes I don't have a global vision, till any farmer is committing suicide or worse anyone is sleeping hungry in my own motherland.) .. That our career can not longer is significant in DRDO or DAE, CTARA or ASTRA can be our dreamed destinations too.. That we can learn from Baker as much as We can learn from Bhabha or Kalam.. That the path of Reddy is as significant as the path of Ramanna.. That a paper pencil research (pure research) is not a sin to commit in our poor nation.. That a weapon is disgraceful, even it is the most powerful and own by us!</p>

<p>I myself sure dont want to see my generation becoming a generation in which only power/market/bombs worshiper are only afloat as role models. One may tell one story! Andre. a character in Bertolt Bretch's <em>Galileo</em> remarks that 'Unhappy is the land where there is no heroes'. To this Galileo responds: 'No, Unhappy the land that needs heroes.' I can not understand whom I should agree with!</p>

<p>With all these jewels lying around, Do we have to worship anyone from land-far-away whoes name is somewhat Indian? And of-course, No scientist can not be great who ever posed happily in military uniform after knowing the significance of what He had done!</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>The doyen of Indian anthropology, M. N. Srivinas, said that an anthropologist is born thrice. Once, when she visit the field to study the 'tribe' she is curious about, second when She started seeing their 'rituals' from their eyes and starts appreciating it in someway. Very few are born twice. Third birth is when she comes back to her adobe after developing some-sort of unbiased world view. Getting the third birth in this sense is the second most difficult thing for a young scholar, and arguably for all the of the scholars. The most difficult is to figure out 'what to do in her life' which generally is asked by someone or other-one like this is a maths question. One could appreciate the confusion once in a while! Its a good thing to be confused!</p>

<p>Confusion in able-indians is way too much. If you give an Indian choice you will know how easily she'd get confused. An unlimited choices makes her unlimited conunfused. Though as Prof. H Narayana, alwasys insists that its good to be confuced, one would miss his point. He generally means getting confused in things, not in life. But that is probably not true. He does not make distinction but the way lectures in classed, one would get this idea.</p>

<p>Plurality, in thoughts, in this 'professional' world is very hard to find. Nonetheless, in this world there are examples which shows the plurality of engineers. The diversity of field they are able to excel is excellent. There is not a field, whether applied or pure, where engineers did not leave their marks. And if you include Osama bin laden, the list become more interesting.</p>

<p>If one browses the oral-history of Princeton university, Math department, about 1930, one get the idea that it is the plurality of the group there which was the most significant elements in there university success. The German and Hungarian contribution toward building this university has been immense. Bardeen interview in which He was remembering his colleagues that time a good read. You can search (<a href="http://blogs.princeton.edu/mudd">http://blogs.princeton.edu/mudd</a>/ and <a href="http://math.priceton.edu/~mudd">http://math.priceton.edu/~mudd</a>). This plurality India lost somewhere in this improvement kind of stuff. Once the great university of Bombay, Delhi, Bengal, Lucknow are now, nothing more than some regional colleges taking a very homogeneous pool of students and not to mention the rise of factions among the faculty. Even in IITs which used be as diverse as India, now this diversity in student pool is much reduced. There is a significant correlation that this much of student this IIT will get from this city, this much will be from that city. In some sense, reservation-quotas provides much more plurality that Rajasthan Kota. And the LAN and internet has already taken a toll on the campus life. Fewer students are exchanging and debating ideas these days though they are picking up them really fast from all kind of sources.</p>

<p>Lack of plurality is obvious in the worldview of fellow student-engineers. If you do chi-square test on the data, you can say with 95% of confidence that this rank will choose this. Almost everything is predictable about indian-genius. If they are good in math, send them to Kota-concentration camp. If they are good in Biology, send them to become a doctor. These are the two type of stream I am familiar with. This may be equally true about other streams. Even on the campuses, when they are on their own, the choices of career is someway or other is fixed by the society. One must not fool oneself with that this has to do with the individual. There is something more significant lies in deep. Two observations are worth consideration. First is by my most beloved scholar Andre Beteille about Indian middle class.<a href="http://www.ambedkar.org/News/TheIndian.htm">http://www.ambedkar.org/News/TheIndian.htm</a>. Most of the engineering students in India are from this category only, no matter how much reservation is there. Second is by Ramachandra Guha, <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=208734&amp;sectioncode=26">http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=208734&amp;sectioncode=26</a> . These two articles speak a ton. However, wandering along, one would like to hear what Arundhati Roy said in "God of small things" - "... they decide whom you should love and how much you should love.. " You can replace 'love' with 'think' and reformulate the sentence. This'd also make sense, and if you are born as a girl or a dalit or a minority, both the sentences will sound very familiar.</p>

<p>My first encounter with this world was in Chennai, though very hot and has the least tasty food for a north Indian, is a city I ultimately I fell in love with .It might be the 'common people' goodness or the vibrating art-culture. Or the people stopping and telling you that the stand of your bike is not in proper place. Or the seats for the ladies in buses are occupied by ladies only. However one of my friend (not the-girlfriend) does not like Chennai, reason she gives, while sitting in a mall in NOIDA with me, "Yaha achcha lagta hai, gaure chitte log dekhkar, chennai main to sab kaale kaale anna log." One of the faculty in chennai college tells the tale, "Once a little boy hurled a stone on the city bus. That made the government to make the bus free-of-cost for children. It was very disturbing for the city that what kind of thinking was there in that kid's mind." These kinds of tale are not prominent in the place I have grown up. Children in north India!!! hmmmm..... Remember Rathore in yesterday newspaper and civil society who was protecting him (even his wife..)</p>

<p>Recently there has been a strong but one-sided battle between value and success. The success is taking precedence over values on our educational campuses. A gold coin speaks in Orhan Pamuk 'My name is red' extolling his virtues. The coin argues that it is him who brings harmony in this world, else these scholars would be cutting each other throat deciding whose work is better. The coin further argues that It is him who decides who is doing a better job. If someone wants to be a famous scholar/artist, She should gets her hand on him. Well, this coin make more sense these days. Its the pay-packages which decides the worthiness of the mind among students. But a new thing has crept in after this coin has spoken. We have developed 'grades/marks/ranks' to judge the intelligence of a person. May be now, a degree (paper) will speak, "If you want to be knows as a famous scholar, get your hands on me." This is evident by the increasing number of degree producing assembly line. That is justifiable if the economy is able to absorb them, they argue.</p>

<p>Mostly my 'tribe' has the pathetic sense of plurality and can not appreciate anything which is not in their syllabus because It'd not give them success (worse, they seem not to appreciate what is there in their syllabus). It is heroic to be Gandhian in North India. Before Munna Bhai it was 'lunatic' and nothing less a crime in Gujrat these days! Gandhi is the personality who is most hated in hindi-belt if you ask me. It started when Gowalikar came to supplant Gandhi. In educated circle at the same time Bill Gates came to supplant Marx who has been demonised by Indian gen-X. Most of them has very obscure idea of him and most of them can not distinguish him from Maoist. Anyway..</p>

<p>We need to formulate our world view. Media is of-course is the most trusted and prevalent instrument in this regard. Recently, It has been abused a lot. P. Sainath has already exposed disturbing details about it. He is easily googable. <a href="http://www.epw.in/">www.epw.in</a> also is a prominent voice in this regard. The leading newspaper in southern peninsula is The Hindu. It wouldn't take much time to compare your beloved newspaper and this one. And if you can not appreciate it, take it from me, you are in a mess. However, it also give jolts to its reader. Sometimes, If its editor-in-chief (N. Ram) daughter tops some exams in 20 people class of Columbia University, It'd make a news (though on the last page). Or sometimes It takes U-turn. If Prakash Karat would not like the N-deal, it'd change the stand. The next day, an article from Editor-in-Chief would appear with all the explanation. But one must not take the wrong idea. People say that it is left bias. Seriously I doubt that. N. Ram may be leftist but TheHindu is not. It is run by a trust. Its editor and owner are not same. Its editorials are not used to separate the advertisements. It has dedicated science and agriculture reporter. Not to mention, its wonderful Sunday Magazine and readers-editor. The best newspaper, if you ask me is 'The Guadian'.. TheHindu is 'Guardian' of India.</p>

<p>I am a trained engineer according to papers I have come to posses. My first 'field work' was in Chennai for 4 years. I was doing my UG in engineering. It was a wonderful experience, it was the first time I came in contact with so many 'kinds'. The 'dhoom gang', in my college, in which everyone owns a motorbike is from Bihar (lately the most fertile land to produce brains, now providing cheap labourers). One of them always has his finger high in the sky and used to say, "Salla jante nahi hai students main kitna power hota hai.. is college is building dhool mian mila doonga.." and other kind of stuff. Second group is from Bengal. I used to get irritated in a situation when another Bengali used to chip in and started speaking to the Begali to one whith whom I was talking. Interestingly, my acquaintanceship will forget me and start conversing with the fellow Bengali in Bengali leaving me alone, trying to make out what they are upto. Third one is of course no group, it was the group of no-group, The malyalis or The malloes, who were just like Arundhati Roy were too polite and had no or few friends. One of them would go to the extreme of politeness while visiting my place, "Can I sit on this chair da!!" He would ask one of us! It was hard not to get surprised. And harder, not to appreciate their culture. So different from my own where ... Well, Tamil culture is the longest surviving culture in the world. And the way it is taking modernity may make any non-traditionalist take a note.</p>

<p>I believe that two kind of people make groups. One is of course who feels insecure, like people from Bihar/UP making groups in other states. Other who does not like different voice and have some sort of chauvinism, like (not all) Bengalis. The latter is however less worrisome.. The Bengali intellectuals are generally feel hurt and never forgiven Gandhi for thwarting 'Bose' attempts to take over the congress leadership. The British act of replacing Kolkata by Delhi -placing the command of Indian politics in the central India - as the capital was already hurting. Probably that is why in Bengal, one find the only 'democratically' elected longest Left rule as an act of assertion of their political sentiments. Anyway, as Ramachandra Guha says in his "An Anthropologist among the Marxist and other essays" that in "every Indian, Gandhi and Marx are always trying to take prominent position".. A good read!Not to mention the contribution of Bengalies intellectual in India. Indian science is literally controlled by Bengalies, and if you like euphemism for that, "Indian science is literally controlled by Presidency College." !! It'd like to comments about other groups in India some other day.</p>

<p>My second field study is known and 'Indian Institute of Technology Bombay'. I got the admission after passing through some 'A', 'B', 'C','D'. This exam, very strangely, made me genius, just in 30 minutes! This only shows the obsessiveness of Indians with the persons who knows how to full-fill the norms. People generally wonder about the intellect of the person who cracked these kind of exams. I used to tell them now they will worry about the worthiness of the exam. "Toppers aise hote hai!!" One of the lab-member of mine remarked after asking me what was my grades in 'Physical electronics'. Its gets harder and harder to be yourself in so-called center-of-excellence or perhaps I still have to see one. Any institute of civilization which can not appreciate the differences is hardly an Institute or a civilization. They must perish.</p>

<p>What makes an Institute, an Institute? Is it government funds, then the university of Dubai would have been the best Institute around. Is it the vision of the Institute, IIT-B has 'gyanam pramam dharma'.. (Dare you say that again!).. Or is it professors? This one is worth a consideration. Its the people around you who could make you see things the way you have never seen. I found Prof. Narayanan (HN) lectures worth more that that all of my 2 years stay in IIT. I'd like to take this chance to comment about HN. He does not get angry, he only gets irritated! Same thing is with MPD but he does not bother what the hell you'd feel. HN'd close his eyes and after a while will ask you that uou should read more. Anyway, He is a mathematician working on networks. He has developed certain theorems which are useful in partitioning the big network in smaller networks. In his lectures, he'd tell stories about Tutte, Green, Sheshu and Reed.. He admires W. Tutte very much. He is concerned about the JEE that it is loosing its discriminatory power. Well, he might be right! Not my cup of tea anyway. After chasting a student that he does not know some fundamentals and wondering how he'd survive, then closing his eyes for a while and again He'd say, "I know all this but I do not know how to cross the road. Everyday its a narrow escape." Other Prof I like is Prof. Vasi. In class He'd urge students to attend the lectures of invited speakers as not to make them felt embarrass by empty coference rooms. Once in a while he would make remarks in class, "Most of you have taken Microelectronics because of good jobs.." (During physical electronics lecture). Quite disturbing if you ask me! He voice generally gets grim when he passes these kind of remarks. One of his early student - was taking part time course of VHDL - recalls, "He used to take long lectures. If we'd complain he'd say, "go and take a cup of coffee and come back"." That time I was a student He had the administrative duties in IIT, still he'd come and take the class. A rare feat to be found in Indian University in which not taking classes is justifiable by some means or others. He was relieved when he came to meet Prof. DKS, DKS asks him, "So they have relieved you." Vasi said very happily, "Yes!!". I was in DKS room discussing about my thesis. Later I came to know what he means by relieving when the director of IIT was not Prof Vasi. Other personality is Prof. Gadre, about whom a prof in school of bioscience remarked, "Achcha Prof Gadre, woh to signal processing ke Bhism Pitamah hai!" A very polite and a dedicated teacher. Remembers most of the students by name and worse, at what day they were not present in the classroom. Asks everyone to meet him personally. Even DKS will tell me, "If you have doubts in signal processing, Guruji se poonch kar aao fir mujhe batana." In terms of genius, no body is as great as Prof. Agashe. Simple, wonderful and cheerful. Once He asks in extra class of Linear Algebra a guy who was sleeping, "What were you doing in the night." Then he chuckled and said, "Since there is no girl in the class, I can say that!!" Most 'matkas' were surprised in the room, however B.Techs were appreciating. There is something only a UG can understand about her college. How bad or good!! Others come and go, few remains to excel. The only bad thing about IIT UG, they do not come back in large number even though DKS asks them in his class that "promise me 20% of you will return!!" He did not ask for "when".. Still the numbers are not that much. Again one may turn to the characteristics of Indian Middle Class. And for worse, to the Hindu ritual of burning their dead. We burn our dead!! or We burn our past!!</p>

<p>Third of my fieldwork right now is in my Job. Best part is that hierarchy is way too much flat here. It was started by IIT-D. The structure is well founded and 'infy lukhkhagiri'. Here the difference among the plural and not-plural thinking is more obvious. People who generally stayed at one place tends to react more to the situation rather than responding. But the worst part is that a few appreciate the other forms of knowledge. Some even scorn at it. That is very non-engineer like.</p>

<p>Once in a while I visit some places, I was in IMSc for my Ph.D. interview in mathematical sciences. I met one of my orkut-frient there who however broke her leg and could not met me second time. There I had a informative conversation with a professor (<a href="http://dilawar-iitb.blogspot.com/2009/05/some-conversation-at-imsc-with-some-of.html">http://dilawarsays.blogspot.com/2009/05/some-conversation-at-imsc-with-some-of.html</a>). The prof would argue that the hindi-belt prodeces fertile minds but.... I'd like to quote Premchad, "A fertile mind is like a fertile land, The weed grows much quickly in fertile land than in fallow land. In a same way, bad thoughts flourish more easily in fertile minds." That is what Premchad thought true and if you are not close to this field, the crop and weeds both look green, the same. Keep an eye, Its you!</p>

		<div class="entry"><h2>अक्टूबर ०१, २००६  </h2>

<p>आज मन कर रहा है की डायरी लिखू . यो तो काफी दिन पहले से ही मन कर रहा था , पर आज मूड हो आया . डायरी लिखने का भी अपना ही मजा है. जब सब कुछ शांत हो, सारी भावनाए उथल पुथल मचा रही हो अगर बहार बारिश हो रही हो तो क्या कहना ! काफी दिन से घर को 'मिस' कर रहा हू. चार महीने पहले ही गया था. वह पर दिन बहुत लम्बे हो जाते है. दो तीन दिन तो अच्छे लगते है फिर बोरियत होने लगती है लेकिन फिर भी मन बार बार घर की और भागता है . इस मेट्रो की भाग दोड दिमाग को तो भाती है पर पर दिल वही पर है नाहर के पुल पर बच्चा पार्टी के साथ . वही झडवेरी के 'बेर' और गन्ने के खेत, और बच्चो के साथ बातें . अभी थोडा सा ही लिखा है और दिल हल्का हो गया.</p>

<p>बचपन के दिन याद आतें है तो हँस लेता हूँ . मम्मी कहती जब छोटा था तो हवा मैं कुछ कुछ लिखता था इसलिए जल्दी प्रिमरी मैं दाखला दिलवा दिया. काफी छोटा था इसलिए हेड-मास्टर नही उम्र बड़ा कर लिखी और मेरा जन्मदिन २५ मार्च १९८६ के बजाये ५ जून १९८५ हो गया . लगभग ९ महीने बड़ा.. हेहेहे !! नाम तो बस, मम्मी ने दिया 'अमर' और बुआ जी ने लिखवा दिया 'दिलावर ' . अब लोग हस्ते है की ये 'दिलावर' है. अरे भाई कैसे समझाऊ की इसमें मेरी क्या गलती है , मैं इतना छोटा था मुझे क्या पता था की नाम मैं कुछ रखा है . पर जो भी हो नाम तो मस्त, ज्यादातर लोग भूलते नहीं है हे हे हे :-)</p>

<p>घर मैं मझला होना यानी वाट लग गयी . बड़ो का रोब सहो और छोटो पर रोब जमाव तो घर वालो की डाट सहो. एक भोला सा, मासूम सा, मोटा सा बच्चा इतना सब कैसे सहता, बेचारा टुबक टुबक के दो चार आंसू बहा लेता और थोड़ी देर ब्ड़ फिर वही पागलो टाइप हसना और फालतू की बक बक. घर मैं सब परेशान की ये बच्चा इतना क्यों बोलता है. पापा से कई बार डांट खाई, मम्मी भी डांटती थी की ज्यादा नहीं बोलना चाहिए. और दादी तो मस्त! कुछ भी करो पर न बोले, मेरी प्यारी दादी आजकल चस्मा पहनती है . ज्यादा बूढी हो गयी है और बोलती है की मेरी उम्र की क्या है :-) हाँ फिर ९० साल कोई उम्र थोड़े ही ना है .</p>

<p>ज्यादा तो याद नहीं है दादा जी के बारें मैं, दादी कभी कभी बताती है बहुत ही ज्यादा मेहनती और कंजूस इंसान थे कभी ना दादी को साडी खरीद कर दी और न गहने बनवाए और अपने बेटे को भी वैसा बना गए. आज भी कभी कभी पुराने दिनों को याद करके दादी का गला भार आता है . 'हरित क्रांति' से पहले हालत बहुत ही ज्यादा ख़राब थी. फसल का तो कोई भरोसा नहीं, बारिश कम हो या ज्यादा दोनों ही हालत मैं बधिया बैठ जाती थी . गेहू तो मानो सोना था. थोडा बहुत होता था वो भी मेहमानों के लिए रख्खा जाता था. पापा बताते है की जब मेहमान लोग आते थे सब बहुत खुश होते थे की आज गेहू की रोटी मिलेगी . चावल और धान की कोई कमी नहीं थी और तीन चार साल का राशन मिटटी के गोदाम में रख्खा जाता था ताकि एक दो साल फसल न हो आराम से जिया जा सके. किसी की आँखों मैं बड़े सपने न थे. नौकरी करना तो जैसे पाप था . किसी दुसरे की गुलामी क्यों करे . घर की खेती है खुद करो. लेकिन फिर भी पढाई के लिए जो इज्ज़त मैंने अपने घर मैं देखी है वैसी मुझे कही और बहुत कम दिखती है . पढाई के बारें में मेरे दादा जी का ख्याल था की पढ़ लिख कर आदमी इंसान बनता है, बोलने चलने का सलीका आता है . पिताजी के बिचार थोड़े 'commercial'  है उन्होंने नौकरी और पैसे को भी साथ जोड़ दिया है . पुराने टाइम मैं गाँव के लोग कुछ ज्यादा ही ख़राब थे . गुटबाजी बहुत होती थी और मेरे दादाजी गाँव से अलग रहते थे. हालाँकि मेरे पापा अकेले बेटे थे और सबकी आँखों के तारे फिर भी आदत मैं वोह दादाजी से भी आगे निकले . नशेड़ियों के गाँव में एक आदमी जो बीडी शराब को हाथ न लगाये, अशंभव नहीं पर मुश्किल तो जरुर है.</p>

<p>दादाजी के आखरी दिनों मैं ४ साल का था. मुझे अभी भी याद है की मैं इमली के पेड़ के निचे उनके साथ चारपाई पर बैठ कर दाल खाता था बिना रोटी के साथ. दादाजी को diabetes थी. मिठाई खाने का बड़ा शौक था उन्हें. लम्बी चौड़ी कद कांठी, ताकतवर, कई बार झगड़ो मैं उन्होंने कई की पिटाई  की. एक अकेला आदमीं और पूरा गाँव दूसरी ओर. १५ साल तक कोई नेयोता नहीं देता था. ओर ना ही दादाजी ने कभी किसी से कुछ कहा. फिर भी उन्होंने हिम्मत ना हारी. १५ साल तक एक सोसाइटी से अलग रहना. पापाजी तो उन दिनों की बात ही नहीं करते. अक्सर दादी बताती है तब समझ मैं आता है की दादी को इतना गुस्सा क्यों दिखाती है गाँव वालो के लिए. खेर मैं कुछ ज्यादा नहीं कहना चाहूँगा मुझे खुद बुरा लगता है.</p>

<p>दादाजी के मरने से ४ महीने पहले मेरा छोटा भाई दिनेश पैदा हुआ. दादाजी उसको देखकर बोलते थे, "इसका मुह तो लौंडियों जैसा है." मम्मी कभी कभी कहती थी की इसकी जगह मुझे बेटी होती तो अच्छा होता. घर के काम मैं तो हाथ बाटती. दिनेश हमेशा ही गुस्सा हो जाता था, बोलता था, "मेरी जगह क्यों, इसकी (मेरी) जगह क्यों नहीं. ये मोटा क्या कोई तीस मारखा है ." :-)</p>

<p>दादाजी की मौत होते ही सब ख़त्म सा हो गया था. पापा को ही सारा काम हाथ मैं लेना पड़ा. दादाजी हमेशा ही पापा को लताड़ते थे की इतना शर्मीला है कैसे काम करेगा. किसी से बात नहीं करता ओर पीछे खड़ा रहता है." १८ साल की उम्र ओर पूरी गृहस्थी ऊपर, पर दादी थी न. सब कुछ संभल गया. पापा की शादी कांठ से हुईं है ओर मम्मी सबसे अमीर परिवार से थी. फिलहाल तो मामा लोगो के रबेय्ये से वह से हालत ज्यादा ठीक नहीं है फिर भी खाता पीता परिवार है. दादाजी का घर तो कोई खास नहीं था पर शायद पापा जी के मेहनती स्वाभाव के ऊपर नाना जी फ़िदा हो गए हो ओर शादी हो गयी. गाँव में अक्सर शादिया छोटी उम्र मैं ही हो जाती है. पापा भी शायद १६-१७ साल के रहे होंगे. पर लगता तो नहीं की कभी किसी बुजुर्ग की सलाह की जरुरत रही होगी.</p>

<p>पापा ने ट्रक्टर ख़रीदा, जमीन खरीदी ओर पिछले २० साल मैं ज्यादा से ज्यादा १९ बार कपडे बनवाए होंगे. बचपन में मुझे उनसे बड़ा डर लगता था. पापा घर में और मेरी जवान मेरे पेट मैं पहुच जाती थी. छोटे भाई को कोई गम नहीं छोटे हो तो सब माफ़. बड़ा भाई दिगराज बहुत डरता था . पापा उसे पढ़ाते थे गलती  पर बहुत मारते थे. बड़े भाई पर क्या गुजरा बचपन में, कैसा रहा वोह तो वो ही जाने पर उसे हम पर रोब ज़माने मैं बड़ा मजा आता था. पता नहीं कहा से नए नए फंडे लाता था. जैसे कोई जादुई शरबत जिसे पीकर आदमी ५ गुना ताकतवर हो जाता है. दिनेश और वोह तो ताकावर हो जाते और मल्ल युद्ध किया करते थे पर मेरा पेट ख़राब हो जाता था . दोनों ही मुझे मार लिया करते थे, एक ही जगह मैं उनसे आगे था वोह था स्कूल , जहा पर मेरा ही राज था. पापा को घर में शोर से बहुत नफरत थी और यहाँ तीन बच्चे , तीनो शैतानो के बाप. खेर हम तीनो पूरा ख्याल रखते थे की पापा के आते ही 'कोमा' में चले जाये.</p>

<p>मुझे पहले से ही त्योहारों, शादियों से कोई लगाब नहीं था. दिनेश का भी कुछ ऐसा ही था पर मेरा बड़ा भाई दिगराज उसे ही जाना अच्छा लगता था. घर से बहार मेरी बोलती बंद हो जाती थी. मैं तो किसी कोने मैं बैठकर किताब लेकर चुपचाप टाइम काटता था और बापस घर जाने की राह देखता. शादियों मैं मेरी भूख ही मर जाती और घर पहुचकर मुझे खाना जरुर खाना था.</p>

<p>बचपन मैं मुझे दूध का बहुत शौक था कुछ ज्यादा ही. खूब दूध पीकर सोना और बिस्तर गीला करना. पता नहीं क्यों घर में दूध नहीं होता था? क्यों गाये भेश  ढंग से दूध नहीं देती थी और दूध में मम्मी पानी क्यों मिलाती थी, अजीब बात थी. फिर पापा ही मौसा जी के साथ जाकर एक गाये लाये थे. तब से आज तक कभी घर पर दूध की कमी नहीं हुई. वोह गाये तो मर गयी पर उसके बच्चे अभी भी घर पर है. कुछ शैतान से, कुछ भोले से कुछ न्यूट्रान टाइप, न कूदते है न उछलते है , बस खाना और सोना, खाना सोना. दादी बोलती है, खाओ जा, हगो जा , खाओ जा, हगो जा.</p>

<p>सुबह सुबह मंदिर में जल चढाने की सनक कब सवार हुईं पता नहीं. ५ साल की उम्र से १६ साल की उम्र तक, चेन्नई आने से पहले, लगभग १० साल तक ये ही चला. सुबह नहाना, फिर जल चढ़ाना, एक दो आरती और शलोक बगेरह बगेरह . धीरे धीरे भगवन से बिश्वास टूटने लगा और न ही हिम्मत हुई की अविश्वाश करू . खेर नास्तिक हो गया हू और आस्तिक होने का कोई चांस भी नहीं है. घर जाता हू तो अभी भी जल चढ़ाता हू., वोह सिर्फ मंदिर की साफ़ सफाई के लिए.</p>

<p>बचपन की यादे काफी कुछ धुंधली सी है. मम्मी पापा से मार पड़ने के episodes  लिखाकर अपनी बेईज्ज़ती क्यों करवाऊ. :-)</p>

<p>प्राइमरी स्कूल तीसरी क्लास से आगे की कुछ यादे बची है. क्लास का मोनिटर और सबसे छोटा. पर बुध्धिमान बच्चो पर कोई हाथ नहीं उठाता ऊपर से में तो मोनिटर, अपना ही राज था. प्राइमरी के लिब्ररी से विज्ञानं की किताबे पढने का मुझे addiction  सा था और कविताओ का भी . कुछ कविताये मुझे अभी भी याद है जैसे,<br/>
गधे ने अखबार पलटकर नजर एक दोडाई,<br/>
बोला गाड़ी उलट गयी है गजब हो गया भाई.<br/>
कौया हसकर बोला अबे उल्टा है अखबार,<br/>
इसलिए दिखती है उलटी, सीधी मोटरकार .<br/>
हा हा हा हा .. :-)</p>

<p>मेरी पहली और आखिरी research  नोटबुक जो मैंने ४ रूपये में खरीदी थी और १ रुपए के डोट-पेन से लिखी थी अभी भी मेरे पास है. आधी ३ दिन में भर डाली बाकी आधी आज तक नहीं भर पाई. मेरे बचपन के दोस्त, दोस्त नहीं classmate, हमेशा मेरे पीछे पड़े रहते थे, किसी तरह से डांट लगे इसे. पर उन्होंने कभी झूट बोलकर डांट नहीं लगवाई और सच पर डांट लगती है तो लगे, विवेकानंद की किताब में कुछ ऐसा ही लिखा होता है. primary की classes को कट गयी धूपघडी बनाते बनाते जिसने कभी सही टाइम नहीं बताया. उधर मेरे एक मामाजी का स्वर्गवास हो गया. छोटे मामा जी. हम उन्हें इसी नाम से बुलाते थे और मुझे बहुत ही पसंद थे. मुझे क्या सभी बच्चो को पसंद थे. लम्बी लम्बी मूंछे, ताकतवर इंसान और नंबर एक के गान्झा पीने वाले. ८-१० साल की उम्र में घर से १५ हजार लेकर भाग गाये थे फिर १५ साल तक कभी असाम, नागालैंड और चीन के बोडर्स तक रहे. ज्यादा कहानी तो नहीं सुनाई वहा की उन्होंने. नानाजी के मरने के टाइम वो बापस आ गये और फिर घर पर ही रहे. उनकी शादी हो गयी और चार बच्चे भी. इससे बुरी खबर मैंने कभी नहीं सुनी थी. घर पर मम्मी रो रही थी और दादी भी फिर अचानक बहुत सारी औरते आकार के साथ रोने लगी. पापा घर से बाहर चले गये और में भी उनके पीछे पीछे. बड़ा भाई और छोटा भाई टुबक टुबक  रो रहे थे. मेरे भी एक दो आंसू गिरे होंगे पर में तो घर से भाग गया था. मामा जी को साप ने काटा था वो तो पता नहीं चला पर था कोई जहरीला जानवर. में उस दौरान कभी कांठ नहीं गया बाद में पता चला की नानी जी रो रोकर पागल हो गयी है और दो तीन साल बाद वोह भी चल बसी. बड़े मामाजी बड़े ही फट्टू किस्म के इंसान है. कामचोर और बड़ी मामी तो उनसे भी आगे है औए अकल में एकदम कम. खेर जैसे तैसे छोटी मामी की हालत तो सुधर गयी और घर अब बिलकुल सही हालत में है.</p>

<p>हमारे घर पर बाहर सड़क की और एक इमली का पेड़ था . था इसलिए क्युकी  अब नहीं रहा. एक बार ३ महीनो तक कुहरा छाया रहा था शायद १९९८ में, तब वो पेड़ सूख गया. मुहल्ले के सारे लोग गर्मी में उसके नीचे सोते थे और बाकी ताश खेलते थे. मुझे ताश देखने में बड़ा मजा आता था. खांसी गाली गलोज होती थी खेर ये तो गाँव वालो की  बोली की शान है. यहाँ तो किसी मेहमान को भी एक तो तो सुन ने को मिल जाती है. मैंने भी ताश खेलना सिखा और खूब खेला. कई बार डांट भी पड़ी मम्मी से, बोलती थी तेरे पापा नहीं खेलते फिर तू क्यों खेलता है. मुझे कुछ समझ में नहीं आता था की इसमें क्या बुरे है , बचपन में क्यों समझ में आता मस्त खेल चल रहा है तो खेलो. को अगर नहीं खेलता तो मैं क्या करू. पर मैं ख्याल रखता था की. ज्यादातर चोरी छिपे ही खेलता था . गुल्ली डंडा और कंचे तो गाँव के बच्चे जरुर ही खेलते है. धूल भरी जम्में पर चड्ढी और बनियान में, पूरी दुनिया गयी घास चराने , हम तो कंचे खेलेंगे . खेलो में मैं तो हमेशा ही फिस्सडी रहा पर खेलने में पूरा मजा आता था. यहाँ तो हारना भी जीतने से अच्छा था खेलने को तो मिलता था.</p>

<p>प्राइमरी के हर साल की परीक्षा के ब्ड़ रिसल्ट्स में मैं अव्वल आता था पर पते की बात यह की कक्षा ४ और ५ को चोरकर किसिस और कक्षा की कॉपी चेक ही नहीं होती थी. सिर्फ इन्टरनल मिलते थे और मेरे जैसे आज्ञाकारी और होनहार बच्चे से भला अच्छा कोई हो सकता था जो मास्टर जी को चाय पिलाता हो वो भी ताज महल. :)</p>

<p>स्कूल में एक अध्यापक आये थे पास के कसबे स्योहारा से, श्री शिवप्रकाश शर्मा ! शर्मा, वर्मा, श्रीवास्तव बगेरह बगेरह नाम सुनते ही कुछ ऐसा लगता था की कोई बड़ा आदमी है . दूरदर्शन की फिल्म्स में सभी नाम ऐसे ही होते थे और कारो मैं घूमने वाले . मुझे तो कार से ज्यादा उनके घर अच्छे लगते थे . बड़े बड़े बंगले. मस्त लगते थे. वैसे कार भी अच्छी थी. गुरूजी सबसे अच्छे अध्यापक थे . उनके पढ़ाने का तरीका अभी भी याद है , बहुत अच्छा था. मैंने उन्हें बहुत चाय पिलाई. रिश्वत नहीं गुरु सेवा. :-) वो जब गिनती पहाड़े करवाते थे तो लगता था की स्कूल सजीव हो गया है. भयानाक शोर मचता था. सब बच्चे खूब तेज़ एक ही स्वर में दोहराते थे . गाँव वालो हो दूर दूर तक खेतो में पता चल जाता था की १२:३० बज गाये है . स्कूल की ईमारत बहुत ख़राब थी, बारिश होती थी तो छत टपकती थी और छुट्टी करनी पड़ती थी और रजिस्टर कही किसी  के घर पर रखने पड़ते थे. सब भीगते भीगते घर जाते थे. मम्मी घर पर चाय पिलाती, एक दो छींक आती और बाकी सब फिर से बढ़िया. आस पास के ३ गाँव मैं सिर्फ एक ही स्कूल था . लड़के लडकिया सभी पढने आतें थे . ज्यादातर लड़के और लडकिया काफी बड़े थे. मेरे ग्रुप में सभी छोटे और पढने वाले थे इसलिए कभी मल्लों ही नहीं पड़ा की छज्जू सोना को इतना क्यों घूरता है और कमल राजू को देखकर इतना क्यों हस्ती है. अपुन तो गिनती पहाड़ो में ही मस्त थे . बाद मैं काफी कुछ पता चला पर अच्छा हुआ मेरे साथ वोह सब नहीं हुआ जो कवेंद्र के साथ हुआ.</p>

<p>खेर स्कूल की नयी बिल्डिंग बनी और हमारी क्लास अब उसमे होती थी. बारिश की कोई टेंशन नहीं. पर बारिश के बाद जो कीड़े मकोड़े बिल्डिंग मैं घुस आते थे उसके साथ शैतानी करने का अपना ही मजा था. बेचारे छोटे मोटे कीड़े, क्या दुर्दशा की जाती थी उनकी. हेहे :-) . नया संदूक और एक अलमारी भी आई और ऊपर लिखा गया "प्रथमीक विद्यायल निचलपुर".</p>

<p>गाँव में उस टाइम जिस तरह स्वतंत्रता दिवस, गद्तंत्रता दिवस और गाँधी जयंती मानते थे फिर वैसी नहीं मनाई . तब दिल में ऐसी ही तरंगे उठती थी जैसी उसे ऑनलाइन देखकर उठती है. तिरंगा हाथ में लेकर मंडली में सबसे आगे चलना और नारे लगवाने का मजा ही कुछ और था. १५ अगस्त तो ठीक थक गुजर जाता था पर २ अक्टूबर और २६ जनवरी को जब नाक बंद होती थी सर्दी के मारे तो "महात्मा गाँधी की जय" की जगह "महात्मा गंडी की जय" निकलती थी मुह से. बच्चे लोग भयानक हस्ते थे. वैसे ऐसा दो तीन बार ही हुआ होगा. फिर भी 'वन्दे मातरम, भारत माता की जय, शहीद सेनानी अमर रहे, सरे जहासे अच्छा हिन्दुस्ता हमारा. देश प्रेम की ज्वाला की जल पड़ती थी. अमूल का विज्ञापन भी कुछ कुछ ऐसी ही भावनाए पैदा करता था . 'भारत उदय' और 'रंग दे बसंती' 'स्वदेश' 'लक्ष्य' से भी उसी टाइप की भावनाए जागती है. पर इन सबमे दिमागी तिकड़म शामिल है. उस नन्हे दिल में कुछ काला था ही नहीं जिसे सफ़ेद बनाने की कोशिश की जाए. हाथ मैं तिरंगा लेकर चलना मानो देश का सेनापति हो और फिर अपने घर के आगे से गुजरो और पापा को मुश्कुराते देख लिया तो बस, बोलती बंद. गुरूजी फिर खुद नारे लगवाते थे उशे पता था घर के सामने ये शर्माता है. आज भी झाकी देखना चाहता हुईं पर यहाँ मेट्रो में dy/dx, laplas और fourier  में ही व्यस्त रहता हू.</p>

<p>घर पर किसी नही सपने मैं भी नहीं सोचा होगा की मैं इंजिनियर बनूँगा या बड़ा भाई pharmacist और छुटंकी botanist . खेर २/३ तो पूरी हो गयी है बस दिनेश का बोतानिस्ट बनना नाकि है (update : Dinesh is a chemist now!). ज्यादा से ज्यादा पढ़े तो हाई स्कूल और कही गलती से इंटर पास कर लिया तो सुगर मिल में चौकीदारी पक्की. वैसे इन गवारों के बस मैं इंटर पास करना नहीं है. बचपन में यही सब सुनता था. इंजीनियरिंग शायद तब इसका कोई मतलब भी जनता हो. मुझे तो खेर अपनी किताबो से मतलब था, लाल बहादुर शाश्त्री, जवाहर लाल नेहरु, भगत सिंह, बिस्मिल बगेरह बगेरह की तो जीवनी चाट गया मैं पर उनकी DOB आज तक याद नहीं हुईं.</p>

<p>मेरे एक मौसा जी प्राइमरी मैं अध्यापक है, और सारे रिश्तेदारों मैं सबसे ज्यादा पढ़े लिखे भी. M Sc  in  Agriculture . काली बर्दी और चकोर टोपी मैं उनका एक फोटो है उनके घर पर. वाह क्या मस्त दीखते है :-) पांचवी कक्षा मैं था तब उन्होंने मुझे 'नवोदय विद्यालय' का फॉर्म लाकर दिया था आगे पढने के लिए. मेरा आगे पढना तो तै था पर 'नवोदय' की बात ही कुछ और थी. उ. प्र. सर्कार का उपक्रम. फॉर्म भर पोस्ट कर दिया और रोल नंबर भी आ गया एक्साम देने के लिए पर जरा देर से. मेरे एक दोस्त का पहले आ गया और मैं रोने लगा की मेरा क्यों नहीं आया अभी तक. घर पर सब परेशान थे की इसे कैसे चुप कराये, कोई और दिन होता तो दो झापड़ रसीद कर देते और दिलावर किसी कोने मैं सुबक रहे होते. पर आज सब ही परेशां थे. सभी सांत्वना देते. मम्मी वोली चलो 'हनुमान चालीसा' पद लो सब सही हो जायेगा. भगवान् मैं बिस्वास तो था ही चार बार पढ़ डाली. शाम को खबर आई की हेड मास्टर के पास आया है स्कूल के. चालीसा पढने के ६ घंटे बाद फल मिला , एक बार और पढनी चाहिए थी. खेर देर आये पर दुरुस्त आये. मैं फिर से हसने और बकने लगा. एक किताब मंगवाई गयी जो मौसा जी नही ही लाकर दी तेयारी करने के लिए. दुपहरी को इमली के नीचे और रात को लालटेन के आगे उसका सत बनने लगा.  सबसे मस्त बात परीक्षा के बारें मैं थी की वो बिजनोर मैं थी. आईला बिजनोर. जिला बिजनोर. शहर, बस में जायेंगे गाड़िया देखेंगे मजा आयेगा. पड़ोस के के टीचर हमें (मुझे और अमित को) बिजनोर एक्साम देने के लिए नियुक्त किया गया. मम्मी नही उन्हें ४०० थमा दिए की ख्याल रखना. हम सिओहरा से बस लेकर बिजनोर चले. खिड़की से बाहर तो मैं सिर्फ रोड को ही देख रहा था. हरियाली तो गाँव मैं बहुत देखी है. वो जो तारकोल की रोड है वोह सांसे ज्यादा रोमांचक थी. काली और एकदम सपाट. मजा आ गया था उस रोड को देखकर. बिजनोर पहुचे तो एक धरम्शाल मैं रुके. २५ रुपए किराये पर. मुझे याद है क्युकी मास्टर जी हिसाब लिखा रहे थे एक कॉपी में. उन्होंने मुझे ३ रुप्पी वाली पोलो लाकर दी. अहली बार मैंने कोई इतनी महंगी चीज खायी. या तो सिर्फ ५ पैसे वाली संतरे की टाफी या परले-जी बिस्किट्स. बिस्किट जब मेहमान घर पर आये हो. सब सबसे ज्यादा रोमांचक था पहली बार, पहली बार बिजली की रौशनी को देखना. मैंने उस बल्ब को इतना घूरा की १० मिनट तक मेरी आँखों के सामने फिलामेंट नजर आ रहा था. That was awesome. पता नहीं मेरे गाँव मैं बिजली कब आएगी. इतनी रौशनी, हे भगवान्. एक बार मेरे यहाँ पर आ जाये तो हम सब अलग अलग पढ़ सकेंगे. मुझे पसंद नहीं था की एक लंप के आगे तीन लोग एक साथ पढ़े जिनमे एक हमेशा सो जाता हो और दूसरा कीट-पतंगे पकड़ता हो. पर दोनों बही तो क्या करे कोई, एक छोटा एक बड़ा. एक को अधिकार ज्यादा एक को प्यार ज्यादा.<br/>
हम धरमशाला मैं ठहर गाये और मैंने पोलो खाखा ख़त्म कर दी. मस्त ठंडी ठंडी थी. कमरे मैं तो जगह थी नहीं इसलिए हमने अहाते मैं बिसतेर लगा लिया कोई दिक्कत नहीं आई क्युकी छत तो ऊपर थी ही. रात को तो मैं कभी देर तक नहीं पड़ता था. जल्दी सोना और जल्दी उठाना. कम से कम जब तक घर पर था तो ऐसा ही तह. यहाँ चेन्नई मैं तो समय से नाता ही टूट गया है. जब मन किया सो गाये, जब मन किया जाग गाये. वहा सुबह हुई तो बहुत सारे लड़के और लडकिया थी. अब लडकियों के सामने कौन नहायेगा. ब्रुश करो मुह धोया और तेयार हो जाओ. एक्साम देने पहुच गये. पेपर देकर घर आ गये वैसे वहा पर एक टीचर से कोई कुछ आकार बोल कर गया और वोह एक लड़की का पेपर सोल्वे करवाने लगा. ठीक है शहरी लोग कुछ करते होंगे. हम तो अपना पेपर दिए और शाम तक घर बापस भाग आये अगले दिन. फिर से सब कुछ पहले जैसा. रिजल्ट आ गया और selection  नहीं हुआ. इलज़ाम गया कॉपी चेक करने वाले पर. इतने छोटे बच्चे पर कौन इलज़ाम थोपता.कोई कानून ही नहीं है. हाँ अगर मेरी मम्मी भी पढ़ी लिखी होती तो शायद मर कर ही उनके तानो से पीछा छूटता.</p>

<h2>अक्टूबर ०२, २००६  </h2>

<p>पापा अक्सर खेतो मैं काम करने के लिए लेकर जाते थे. किसान का बेटा काम नहीं करेगा तो और क्या करेगा. ऊपर से कोई आप्शन भी तो नहीं है. बड़ा भाई आसानी से काम करता था उसे मजा भी आता था पर मुझे बिलकुल भी पसंद नहीं था. कोशिश करता की कोई बहाना मार दू. अक्सर बहाने कामयाब भी हो जाते थे पर ज्यादातर बार साथ जाना ही पड़ता था. गन्ने के खेत की निराई गुड़ाई, गाये भेंसों के लिए चारा लाना और बगेरह बगेरह छोटे मोटे काम लिए ही जाते थे. फावड़ा चलन तो बस मैं नहीं था उस उम्र मैं पर अगर मैं enthu  दिखता तो ट्रेनिंग मिल जाती. मैं अक्सर एक घटिया सा मुह बनाकर खेतो पर जाता और मन मारकर काम करता था. धान की रोपाई हो, गेहू की बुबाई या खेत तेयार करना हो, मक्का या चारी की कटाई. काम से बचने का सबसे अच्छा तारिका था की किताब लेकर बैठ जाओ. जब लगता था की पापा अब खेत पर जाने वाले है तो मैं समाधी लेकर अपनी किताबो के साथ बैठ जाता था. और उनके जाने तक का वेट करता था. :-) और उनके जाते ही बाहर जाकर गुल्ली डंडा.</p>

<p>मेरे गाँव मैं एक और दिलावर है. उसके घर का नाम है 'सिफन'. उसे स्कूल जाना बिलकुल पसंद नहीं. कक्षा ६ मैं आया तो उसका दाखिला स्कूल मैं करवा दिया. पहले ही दिन उसे मार पड़ी. हर आकर रोने लगा, भानायक डर गया था वो. चार दिन तक बुखार आया और स्कूल का नाम सुनते ही चीखता था. कोई इतना परिश्रम करे तो सफलता तो मिलनी ही है. उसका नाम स्कूल से कटवा दिया और आजकल अपने दादा जी के साथ अपना पसंदीदा काम करता है खेती बारी , (update : his grandfather expired 6 month ago). मेरा फैन है. मुझे देखते ही बत्तीसी दिखा देता है, मुझे हंसी आ जाती है.</p>

<p>खेतो मैं काम करते वक्त, ऊँगली काटना, पैर का काटना, तातेय्या का काटना, जोंक, केकड़े इत्यादि आम बात है. एक दो बार ऊँगली काटी है. एक बार कुछ ज्यादा ही गहरी. फिर मैंने उसे धूल मैं कर लिया था ताकि कोई देख न ले डर के मारे. पर खून था की रुकता ही नहीं था. फिर बलराम जी नही देख लिया और मुझे पट्टी करने के लिए seohara  ले गये. डांट नहीं लगी की क्यों दरांती के साथ खेल रहा था जब छोटा है तो. एक दो बार ही मैंने पैर कटा होगा. एक बार जोंक लग गयी थी तो मैंने उसपर तम्बाकू डालकर मार दिया उसे. जोंक पर नमक या तम्बाकू साल दो तो एकदम मर जाती है. नमक वाला फंडा तो सबको पता है जिसने शक्तिमान के साथ जोंक-जुनका की लड़ाई देखी है. तातेय्या का काटना बहुत गन्दा होता है. जहा कटती है सुजा देती है. अकसर मुह पर ही कटती है. अजीब जानवर है कटेगी तो मुह पर. एक दिन तक आंख नहीं खुलती सुजन के मारे. सब हसते है की और भाई, मौसी ने काट लिया.</p>

<p>जिद करना गंदी बात. बचपन मैं यही सिखाया गया. ज्यादातर जिद नहीं की पर कभी कभी करनी पड़ती थी खासतोर से कपड़ो को लेकर. मक्का की खील खाने का भी लग ही मजा था. उसे लेने पर घर वालो की मनाही भी नहीं थी. मम्मी खुद ही चाट बनती थी और आलू के पराठे एकदम मस्त वाले.</p>

<p>दादी और मम्मी की ज्यादा नहीं पट्टी. खेर सास बहु के traditional  रिश्ते के बारें मैं जितना कम बोलू उतना की अच्छा है. और है भी मेरे औकात से बाहर की बात. खेर जो भी हो मुझे तो उनकी लड़ाइ में मजा सा आता था. मामाजी की मौत के एक महीने तक तो उनमे मत बोलचाल रही पर फिर पड़ोस की औरतो को ये बात हजम नहीं हुईं और षड़यंत्र रचे गये. नतीजा अब सामने है. खेर उनके रिश्तो की कडवाहट हम पर कभी नहीं थोपी गयी और ना ही हमने कभी इस बात को कोई भाव ही दिया.</p>

<p>पापा को typical  इंडियन फाठेर ही रहे. बच्चो से कम बोलने वाले और जिद को philisophy से समझाने वाले. पापा बचपन मैं मुझे कभी पसंद नहीं आये. अब बात कुछ और है.</p>

<p>छोटा भाई दिनेश बचपन मैं बहुत ही दुबला पतला हुआ करता था . कुछ खाता था तो पचता नहीं था. दिन दिन सूख रहा था तब मैंने अपनी पाचवी की किताब से मम्मी को एक घोल के बारें मैं बताया 'dehydration  '  घोल. हमने उसे उस दिन बनाया उसे चूहे (दिनेश) को पिने को दिया. taste  तो ज्यादा अच्छा न था पर उस एबहुत फायदा हुआ. तो क्या हुआ खोज तो मेरी ही थी ना! :-) अब वो मुझे 'चूहा' बुलाता है. :-)</p>

		<div class="entry"><h2>By our staff reporter (stenographer):  </h2>

<p>There is a very jubilant mood among 'ghar ki murgis' in Nichalpur. Because their beloved equation of their well-being '<em>ghar ki murgi daal barabar' </em>is showing wonderful numbers after the skyrocketing price rise in <em>daal.</em> You might be aware that this equation fetched a <em>'kukduku prize' </em>for <em>Ramlaal Murga </em>who was an economist. This prize is given by 'Gangaram Academy of Science' and 'Ramlaal' was the only Murga ever to win it.</p>

<p>However, there were some voices of concerns who were asking why some of 'ghar ki murgis' vanished and their remains found on the backyard, just like of Ramlaal. Some people are saying that that is an act of committing suicide since some Murgis can not stand the mental pressure or rising economy. Some are saying that they have committed suicide because they were consuming liquors. Some even believes that is work of "Chicxals' who believes that some humans eats because they can no longer afford 'daal'. They are fightening for 'Ghar ki Murgi' emancipation from a threat unknown. They might have killed them.</p>

<p>There were celebration all the night. There was some MOU signed between them and a FAT CAT who visit this village sometimes. The details of the MOU has not been made 'public'.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Some randomnesss about numbers.</p>

<p>Never forget to confess few mistakes of your life in the openings of your novel. Mostly mistakes, if they are committed by successful people, have to be three. Whether they are Bush war policies, Darwin's mistakes on his voyage, or Obama's mistakes on Health care system in US. In some of the religion 3 is symbol of satan. Interestingly Google Finance does not produce any results if you search plain "mistake" since no stick is named like that (I somehow found it interesting). If your are talking about wonders or adventure use 7 or 11. If you are a programmer and loves random number, than you know why should you avoid asking people number and making a table of them and calling it random number. Donald Knuth spend a significant time to warn you that people love picking up 3, 7, and 11. May be that is why mistakes and idiots have to be three while wonders, adventures, and sins had to be 7. Few awesome personality could be coded like 007. Even the most crappy OS is named after it (Windows 7) whose saner version I am using right away in cyber cafe. And ya if the font size of your name on the cover of your book equals to the IQ of a genious then its a bestseller. That is 140 pts or bigger font size!!</p>

<p>Lets get to other things, Any economists will tell you the real importance of number and how should you use them (A banker will only worry about the decimal place and needs that much of education only. That why all the stud on the wall streets are either 'drops out' or 'five.someone'.).</p>

<p>Numbers are important in research also. Every now and then they tell you that eat this and that to avoid this and that diseases. After six month they will say no dont eat this and that to avoid this and that. Basically, there sponsors write their research reports and ask them to prove it somehow using some numbers. They do it really well. THERE ARE SOME STATS WHICH SAYS THAT 99% STATS ARE MADE UP! (That's goes like a joke in mathematical circle).</p>

<p>There will be no discussion about numbers without a mention of our beloved '0'. Never try to underestimate the power of using 'zero'. Indians loves this 'zero' way too much. After its invention, We are hell bent on adding this in the 'fundamental knowledge' of this world. Ofcourse I am undermining Indians. What you want to say, "We had Ramanujan, and ........ummmm................. some Indian born American who gives .................ammm .. who won some Nobel prize..." Ya but you are not absolutely right. We have much more than that. Not to the fundamentals but after the independence, we did enough to the needs of this nation. ISRO remote sensing satellite deserves nothing less a Nobel. No no giving this would be dishonoring it. Or DRDO embedded system technologies, or CSIR material science research. TIFR contribution to 'string theory' and 'mathematics'. IISc contribution towards 'technology of national development'. Not to mention ISI contribution towards providing statistics and building mathematics in India and IITs to develop themselves as brand which by the way could be a good PR scam. Ooops, I said it again. Now there will be backlash. Criticizing and Defending IITs are fashionable. Chetan had made it and now he even trying it to make it 'a school of thought'. He still writes about them in TOI. Interestingly the timing and the titles of his articles rhymes well with market. If "three idiots' is being released this week then the article is 'Indian institutes of idiots'. Never mind inside is same old story how much He is in pain and government is doing nothing. Told ya his marketing team tells from taking data from google trends that now our readers wants to hear something bad about our educational systems and this should be the style, your last style did not receive that much reader or else our best stenographer (they call then journalist inside their premises) will write it using your name. You'll get your paycheck! What you think? Inside IITs we criticize it way too much, more that this Chetan dude could ever imagine but somehow we get angry when an outsiders dare to criticize. We simply tell them "Fuck off man, get a life!". Somehow just like someone girlfriend/boyfriend, IITs has becomes a part of our identity. We can not allow others to criticize her/him no matter how we dislike her/him. And inside IIT also its the same story. A M. Tech (matka) (I am not so proud 'matka' cause the number I got in my salary is not up the number which are expected from a 'stud/machau' matka!) can not criticise a B. Tech. (Batka/Bhatka) ideas of IITs. or even his/her distant cousins DD- Dual Degree (duddas) . They will tell him/her the same things but rather politly. A phd will get the same response from M. Techs. Haha, Ph.D. is a very poor creature in IITs. First of all he suffers from the same syndrome by which all of market-fundamentlist suffers. It is known as TINA syndrom. TINA = There Is No Alternative. This name is not known inside IITs. Most of them are market worshiper, who would like to understand something if His/Her future salarey depends on not understanding it. Anyway, it goes like "(S)he had nothing else to do so (s)he came for Ph. D." But the truth is, that it is true in almost all the cases. Its not like resources or the poorly paid scholarships its just out great Indian idea of 'scholarships'. Few are of course exceptions and they are not going to read it anyway. Anyway, Its not easy to make 'identities', may be another blog on 'identity crisis in IITs' some other day. I know it wouldn't be good for my health but sure my profile view will increase. A little price to pay. Number matters! Anyway sane Proferssor over there are not worried about there paypackages as TOI makes you believe it but its that IITs no longer producing professors, least the scholars. But things are much better than highly branded US system. Dare you say, "Gyanam Pramam Dharmah", Fuck off dude, get a life!</p>

<p>Back to numbers, we have seen Copenhagen, how obscenely they used numbers the way Windows use numbers to tell you how much time is left in installation. 5 minutes somehow passed in 15 seconds. Sometimes 15 seconds remains 15 even after 2 minutes. Long live relativity or some space-time curvature kind of funda. Windows is so close to discover time travel. Anyway, Now we are left with disaster. if anyone is reading this after the disaster for somehow some humans have survived the disaster, I regret that I liked the idea of predatory markets and had the big plan for myself at the cost of yours well being. But you can forgive me since I am a farmer by birth. I grew my own food. My contribution towards this would be one of the least. I will try to do my best to delay the disaster. I do care about next generation. People over there tried to convince other that climate is not about numbers only. Ha! what a crime against science. Fuck off man, get a life!</p>

<p>After Godel incompleteness theorems, its getting harder to trust numbers or axiomatic mathematics to be honest and precise. Wiles proof of Reimann conjecture gave some hopes about that one day we could fathom the numbers and their way to behave. But that dude used computer and left the bigger problem of analytical solution for someone else. Primes have been a pain in our ass for so long time, bigger pain than a single electron who keep proving that he is smarter that 6 billion people and keep laughing at our face! They build a string theory but.....if you know the story...</p>

<p>It's been a war of numbers all along. People are fighting over it arguing if in India 33% or 75% people are poor. or if x or y number of farmers have committed suicides. Whether railway profit is 'n' or 'm'. Or whether temperature will rise by 1 degree or 3 degree.. But whichever number will win, thanks to The Great Indians wit, 'Zero' will always survive. We have given to this world which can not be destroyed no matter how much they try to kill it. Its the 'zero' which will gonna live if other numbers will keep fighting. Its not pretty number. Its the ruthless one and the most cunning. Neither it is beautiful nor cute.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>I am naive but that would not deter me to blog about something which disturbs me. Some random thoughts.</p>

<p>"Ladko ko kaam hi kya hota hai flirting ke alawa.... [pause] par kuch sensitive bhi hote hai." (Boys have no other work to do but flirting, .... but some are sensitive.) These words could be of any disillusioned but hopeful girl that in humanity, the less-fair gender can not be an animal all the time. He might be sensible at times. The pause before the last statement says it all. Its the hope in her, no matter how bleak, which forces her to add this optimism.</p>

<p>Nobody is denying that boys spend a significant part of their time rubbing their dick. And its very hard to find a boy with internet connection who somehow (or magically) did not discover <em>Savita Bhabi</em>. That make sense since these days every porn star trying to download herself/himself on your PC and if you have windows, then your life could be very easy/hard. Not to mention friends sending all the wisdom in your mailbox. The other half of this species might wonder if there is no other things which could be liked by this "flirty" gender. There are studies, (though the publisher never reveals the data and methos) that men think about sex in some X minutes. And I remember that this X is fairly small number. As to say, A normal guy always thinks about sex. Them its really remarkable how come a guy can spend a significant life in office without raping someone or can travel by train, or spend his time with books and can concentrate. Anyway, one knows how much sex addict one is. But the media can create the mistrust between the gender.</p>

<p>The problem, disturbingly, is very high among teenager and in early 20's. Its really hard to believe that a guy could do any good for a woman without having any not-good intentions. And this is mostly true!</p>

<p>How come, in a species, two gender can have such a small trust and/or fear (given the fact one gender does not eat other after sex). The reasons are simple. First the crime against women are on rise. If one consider "disturning one's dignity" also a crime than these number can not be measured.</p>

<p>But do we have to make our teenager so much distrustful towards each other?</p>

<p>A recent article in TOI in which the writer was commenting about the date rape. The topic is framed such a way that one may become so much paranoid about the 'other half'. The issue is so sensitive that we even can not complain why they are making a devil out of every guy. She started it by invoking the role of hormones and blah blah. I was so disturbed that I did not read it proper. And no girl would have stopped in the middle without finishing it. I can not even say what I really like to say there. told ya, issue is very sensitive.</p>

<p>Security is the first thing which a women always look for if a man can provide. Leave alone the financial one, in every sphere of life. The rising economy has indeed added to this problem. Mostly mentally. As UN report of gender inequality 2008 will tell you. A disturbing summary. http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Default.aspx (India is in South Asia)</p>

<p>The communication between them has always been low. Few friends are comfortable talking about gender sexual of mental issues. They still making money by publishing "What a woman/man wants?" or "He is from there and she is from there?". Some of the biggest philosopher declared that they are not able to solve this puzzle of what women want?. Too much for both of them are living together for that long.</p>

<p>If a sibling is not the other gender then this mistrust is more acute. In all brothers or all sisters family, teens are more confused about the other gender. Even in the families with both sister and brother, the understanding is not very much improved but "Take things easy! Boys will be boys!" attitude can relax the agony.</p>

<p>One likes to be understood more that one wants to be loved. Give him/her time. My gender is running a big scam to manipulate girls. Media in our hand so is TV. We expect you to be low on your dignity, submissive to our authority. We attach moral to it, so you dont even criticise it. The media, News-papers, A, B, C,..,M...,Z TV; femine magazine makes you believe that depicting you as an object is the sole purpose of your existence. We make you 'heroine' for that. We give you titles 'Miss Universe' to enjoy more naked shows. (We call it beauty and art). Women scientist and engineer do not make the headlines. We do not give awards to great mother, great wives, or great sister. These roles are not good! "No these are subjugation of one gender towards other gender. This is slavery! Women must break away their barrier and must become an object to please manhood. Spending time with her children and making a man/woman out of them is not a profession. Why shouldn't child be cared for by husband. Family is perverse. Be single and spend more in economy." Yes! ofcourse We can fight over who should take care of children and who should go out for work while making our own children feeling unwanted. Society does not change overnight and its the more resilient who should take the lead. Do you think your husband could ever be more capable of taking care of your child?</p>

<p>All faults are not in us only. Probably something is wrong in girls also. Probably that is why most of the romantic singers are either single or gay?</p>

<p>But no matter how optimistic you are about us, Never forget what a wise woman said, "A gentleman is only a sleeping wolf!"</p>

<p>I agree with her. But we can keep this wolf tamed most of the time.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Well, I have read George Orwell's '1984' and 'Animal Farms' and might have got carried away. He was such an intelligent dissident. I have certain reservations about India's future. To sum up I see India as George Orwell '2020' with some obvious modifications. I am not worried about top 5% of the population but the bottom 90%. If you are not among them, this might not make sense.</p>

<p>One get success if one enjoys the things around one. A rich gets richer if (s)he enjoys richness around him/her. A poor get success (read gets poorer) if (s)he enjoys things around him/her. A person who enjoys life rather than things in the life gets to know the other world. A poor may get rich and rich can renounce everything to become poor. A mathematician may turn into a historian and a engineer could become a social worker. A politician may become a great man and a great man may live a life of obscurity and nobody will know about him.</p>

<p>India, my mother, one must acknowledge her persistence against all odds. She survived! Even Ramachadra Guha's in his masterpiece "India After Gandhi" wondered on and explained "why India has survived?".  All the times after independence, almost everyone in larger western intellectual sphere  was busy predicting the demise/collapse of Indian state into separate nations. Fortunately, We survived all of this.</p>

<p>It might be very premature on the part of 23 year old guy to pass judgments/views on the future of India who had bellied all the experts through out the world since the time invaders started pouring in.</p>

<p>One may like to turn to fiction to express his maverick/dissident opinions just like Arundhati Roy. Fiction has this wonderful quality which express reality in the most convincing form. I would like to do that some day. If you give just plain facts, even the most honest one, then also you run the risk to find yourself in the never-ending debates. But that is also very necessary. At least once in a while we all should take part in the fierce debate. One get to know how the most ludicrous opinions can be expressed in the most musical/convincing way. Just like most of the modern day songs which have nothing in lyrics but still catches our imagination. Not to mention the movies!</p>

<p>No doubts that India had fared extremely well in the past. I am not talking about post 1990. She could withstand other cultures as well as religions even if they are imposed on her. She swallowed and digested everything. Whoever came here became Indian while giving her few of one's color. Now we are one of the most diverse nation in this world! We are extremely proud of it!</p>

<p>Yes We have grown to be a complex nation, a complex network, which is stable, is not prone to small disturbances. Its got its stable points. Its the small homogeneous networks which are most unstable towards disturbances (Recently Switzerland.. no no people of Switzerland banned any new building of minarets!). Probably they must do a case study on India how she managed in the most of the conflicting times. Even now, telangana and maratha manus issue is burning her! But anyway, she had seen worse!</p>

<p>Any network whether  social, personal or electrical can enhance its stability by introducing a small negative feedback. However, A positive feedback creates oscillation and over time it breaks down the whole system, its makes the system to get short term performance but ultimately it breaks it down. Just lik e in case of a new relationship, praising other gender (read giving positive feedbacks) speed up the process of getting him/her into a relationships. A frank (negative feedback) feedback might have cause it to go slow. Nevertheless, the negative feedback, generally comes from the sensors, located at the output, reduces the oscillations and it makes system to take more time to reaches its goals. The sensors sends feedback back to the component who is producing the output. Like a temperature sensor located in your room send the feedback signal to the air-conditioner. Now the controller of the a.c. decides whether to allow ac to chill the room further. Imagine, that the any of the two among sensor, a.c. controller, and ac got some vested interest and starts colluding. Controller might be dismissing sensors signal as 'dissident' or 'snobbish' etc.. And the time you gets home, your house is freezed to death, But that is reversible. You can correct these things without much loss.</p>

<p>But there are few things which can not be reversed. Whether it is oil, minerals, water or education. An uneducated children today can not be educated tomorrow when He could be tiff and rigid. These are the people, who stays at the bottom for none of their faults. These are the people who made this system (government) so that it might get some resources for a while so that later in his/her life (s)he starts producing. At this time, our government is not listening for his/her demands. Its not government responsibility to educated citizen? Its market who will decide! The negative feedback given by the some honest sensors who are expert in this field. (My definition of the experts is not degree holder but the guys/girls who stays in the field to study). But it is deliberately/conveniently  ignored. See, We have rising medical tourism, We could be the destination of world class education (ummm.. world class professional training). But Imagine a land where more that 3 out of 4 person does have the purchasing power of Rs 20 or less a day. Would you believe that any of them can be included in this. You think that the 'Great Market' will allow them to be the part of this. Anyway, competition does not ensues inclusive growth even when it is perfect. In India, it is not perfect, but that is a different story. Now you get a network in which more than three fourth of the components are not the part of the activity which makes this network running. What they will do then, they will produce noises (dharna and other stuff), they halt the flow inside the network, they disrupt. Its hard to make a men sit idle. Either consume his energies into the betterment of the system else (s)he will create troubles. It makes it harder for this network to sustain. Then it tries to isolate the noise-generating components. (You might be aware the not so long ago Delhi government tried to impose a rule that no-one without an i-card will be allowed to enter Delhi, Now we are seeing UID program. They are making sure by hiring a technocrat that enough policy and social gaps are left which can be utilised later. This you might see as the inter-cities passport just like China. We have seen their SEZ concept being utilized to grab land. Never mind, whatever is going to be produced on these lands (whether software or electricity) will not be given to them, even though the promise is their development. "The biggest hater of China now the biggest lover - Amit Bhaduri, in EPW".) But humans are not electrical components which can be removed from the system!</p>

<p>Information flow in human network is like current flow (control signals) in electric network. Who ever produce this current is called 'source' and other depends on it. Fortunately, a source in electric network never minds who is consuming its current (being controlled by it). It does not have any vested interest. It does not want to get more powerful (read more controll over the other passive components). It controlls and other components acknowledge it. That's why the computer, mobile phones works so well! But human-network is not like that. A powerful wants to get powerful and a rich richer. How can this be done? Either you create resources or displace them. Just like butter is made out of milk so one layer can get rich. Everything was there, still wonder how you get that rich layer of butter. Indian economy is like that, If richer gets richer and poor are getting poor, then obviously butter came out of the milk only. Anyway, creating resources is painfully long process, displacing them is very easy. But still we are not that ruthless, so you must convince everyone (or people who matters) that this indeed is not the case. This is how we are creating resources. An example, unlike China, we import more than we export, so how come our foreign reserves could be ours. Its the liquidity, invested heavily by FDI, FII, NRI. They will run away with the first sign of panic. But we are not worried. Who trust numbers, they are painfully boring. To get powerful in a human-network, you need to control the flow of ideas/information. You need to control the most prominent information sources.. Yes I am talking about media. Now the editors and the owner of the biggest media houses are the same corporate guys. Remember Italian PM Berlusconi is also a media baron. His rise in Italy is nothing less then the disaster for democracy and a wonderful and painful examples how media can influence the voters. In India, we are lucky because the person who votes does not read them anyway. His personal experience shaped his world-view, that is why India-Shining did not work for BJP.</p>

<p>Now these super-information-sources are controlled. Now you want your readers to fall in line with you so they can not criticize you. They tell them what they want to listen. They captures their imagination when they are young. So a newspaper which boast itself of not having a single book-review page starts making them believing that they have great plans to "teach India". You need energatic and ignorant person, young or old, younger is beeter. (S)he will stay with them longer if caught young. In teenage they instills fear in them about their parents, they tell them about how cool it is not to be the part of the things going around them, they tell them why they should read about "three mistakes of someone else life" while the more serious/issues should be ignored or are not cool for them. They tell them, why they should hate their natural colours and turn to fairness creams, they tell them why they should compete with each other in this ruthless world where only fit survives. They tell them why market is more important than their society, they tell them why they shouldn't concentrate on politics because if gets to know its them who wields the real power, their days are over! They tells them why its cool to consume at the cost of your planet life, they tell them how dirty our politics had become, never mind they are friends with them. Basically they need to turn them to their religious "the market" which is chasing its own holy-grail, "The invisible hand of itself." (P. Sainath)</p>

<p>There are other important components. In electric networks, they are called filters. They filter out unwanted frequencies. Now for perfect control, you need to filter out dissidents. (Ever wonder that anything significant which came out is this word were came out from dissidents.) You need to prove that the only I am right. They have to make a disapproving meaning out of the word 'dissidents'. Just like "Brutal (Made out from 'Brutus' who killed 'Caesar' out of the conviction that Caesar had become a danger for state, a patriot, if you ask me) and 'hector' (A great troy warrior who was much better personality than Achilles'). See they can make a crap out of a man. In human-networks, our universities, school, institutes acts like filter.. You have to control them also. You need ignorant people. You have to make them believe than they must concentrate only on their studies and forget about the world. They even attach morals with it! If you get educated in world-class institutes (mostly managements and economy), they will make sure, that leave alone talking you stop thinking about certain ideas, (remember how university of Chicago and Manchester threw out Keynesian from their syllabus, Now he is back after the economic crisis. ) Our old great universities of Delhi, Mumbai and Lucknow and others are reduced to regional colleges to make sure no new confronting ideas should not germinate. People love it. Now our hostel are reduced to 'kachcha baniyan sukhane ki chhawni' and our universities are selling/making degrees as they are made in some sort of assembly line. Sure, they will work well in back-office kind of work!!</p>

<p>A lot have been written about the disparity in India and the pattern on growth which is not even. If I talk about this that would be redundant. That also not my belief that one should not heap repeated things on the pile already so vast. But we are blessed with short memories. Every now and then all this sound novelty and unbelievable.</p>

<p>India had been able to confront diversity but inequality is very dangerous thing. Indians looks at others first! If electricity is not coming in one's home, he go and look at his neighbour home first. If there is electricity, he became restless otherwise he is ok. Its not our very nature to not to give damn if our neighbour has more than us.</p>

<p>Sleep Well, Eat Well, 2020 is coming!! But apocalypse is not right now, India will survive! So what, even dogs survives on the road sides. What I am worried about, Will She live her life as She deserve to? If you think that survival is our ultimate aim, then whatever I say is crap!!</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Yesterday while watching CN at my Paying Guest residence, two kids came there bubbling around.. One was a boy and other  was a girl. They were happy that I was watching CN. When their mummy came, he said, "Mummy, ye bhaiya bhi cartoon dekhte hai.." with a wide smile on his face. Later they went to shopping and Ayush that kid stayed with me.</p>

<p>I taught him how to tie show-laces which he found very easy. Then I made him a paper camera which is by the way very famous :-) ... He was happy with that.Then a bird and elephant and donkey uising papers. When I was making them, He asked, "Bhaiya ye doosre bed par kaun sota hai. Aapki girldriend?" "Hehe, nahi mera roommate. Tumhe lagta hai meri girlfriend yaha soti hogi.".<br/>
"Aapki girlfriend hai naa?"<br/>
"Hmmm,, lets say no! Tumhari hai"<br/>
"Haan! do hai naa!!"<br/>
"Arrey wah, par ye to gandi baat hai.. ek hi girlfrined honi chaiye."</p>

<p>He smiled and said ,"Theek hai ek ko main chor dunga, use aap rakh lena."<br/>
Kitna achcha bachcha tha.. I asked, "Kaun si wali"<br/>
"Meri do girlfried hai, Yana aur "some name i forgot" aap Yana ko le lena."<br/>
"Kyu Yana tumhe pasand nahi hai.."<br/>
"Arrey bhaiya ... pahle to mujhse itna ladti thi naa... mujhe dekhte ki ladne lagti thi.. main use bolta tha 'Yaana main tera bana dunga banana!"</p>

<p>"To fir woh tumhari girlfreind kaise bani"<br/>
"lambi kahani hai, aap use rakh lena par woh bahut choti hai!"<br/>
"Koi baat nahi, saath main cartoon dekhne ke kaam aayegi"<br/>
"Haan! par jab main aau to usko bhaga dena fir hum dekhenge, Doremon aur Dragon-ball Z"<br/>
"Woh Goku bala aur uska beta Gohan"<br/>
"Arrey bhaiya ab to uske bete ka bhi beta ho gaya hai.."</p>

<p>His parents came back after shopping and so I had to say good-night after giving him and his sister all the paper-folding I had made for them.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>I just came back from the IMSc after giving my interview. There, I met with some of the professors and researchers. Some of them turn out to be alumni of the IIT-B so the feeling for fraternity was quite obvious there. I was staying in the institute and had some conversation with faculty, students and other students who came here for interview. Then One day I went to IIT Madras to check out the facilities which I can use during my doctorate here at IMSc.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>(This blog were changed slightly after first comment to neutralize the tone of this observation. Its a personal experience and can be labeled as blah blah.. )</p>

<p>I visited this institute in April 2009 for some official research work... no no .. for some project work since the lab in my institute was closed for some time .. actually I was fed-up being on the same campus for a long time.</p>

<p>Journey was a pathetic as it could be in a sleeper class. The only good thing was that I was accompanied by a pretty girl who turns out to be a very good listener with a very compatible sense of humour. So my mouth was dry  and her stomach was about to implode. She enjoyed more that I did.</p>

<p>I always kept this institute in very high regard especially its awesome resilience with with it kept its soul with the research. I still have no regret not to joining this institute but rather opt for IIT bombay for PG. I am writing this blog from the campus of Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai which I'd love to join as Ph. D. in Theoretical Physics. IISc, which has seen towering personalities, most self effacing and selfless of men, some merely capable men as its directors has maintained its glory notwithstanding the iron law of Indian institutes which enjoys the short periods of glory depending on the director's capabilities. It might have not produced Nobel laureates but it has done much batter. It has created human resources over the time which has transformed the Indian science and technical prowess in a way that none of the other institute have done. Unlike IITs which are hell bent to produce human resources for MNC's. The role of IITians on the indian society deserve separate blog and a scholarship way beyong my scholarship.. here I can only say.. In the land of western dominance where white scholarship is only scholarship.. in a nation whose media is obsessed with someone six pack abs or bikini babes (or to worse Raj Thackeray or local  stenographic nit-pickings)... in a society in which intelligence, on the various level defined by the marks - ranks- money in Jobs - fame - ... in a nation with over 1 billion people who looks for someone with white skin to analyse even her own personal affairs... in a nation with pathetically indifferent young generation who even does not care to vote (remember 43% Mumbai voted even after the terror attack after which elites were seems to be raging for election. Might have seen TOI, in which one celebraty was saying ,"Oh! I vote every year." Every year.. oh! for the sake of democracy!) ) .. anything could make sense. And if New York Times and Wall Street journal says that its the reverse brain drain now, then it has to be right.</p>

<p>Anyway IISc, The atmosphere was as pleasing as the sights of its buildings. All the buildings style were remarkable homogeneous.. as homogeneous as the thinking of the whole batch in IIT. There are very few in IITs which think otherwise, and more the fame and sense of identity gripping the already mess-up IITian, there are very little hope that the next generation of the IITians are going to think otherwise. None a single IITian has ever joined army to serve (might be there one or two, I'd be more than humbled to know that) his/her own India. However, there are some remarkable examples came out of these campuses in early days. I don't know how many of them from this generation are going to add on to this rather that enjoying the other's established identity.</p>

<p>I don't understand why I get so bitter when it comes to IIT's. Anyway I am a alumni of this institute but I don't like to be known as IITian (or perhaps, I don't deserve this identity).</p>

<p>On one aspects, IISc failed miserably is there is lack of humanities and social sciences on her campus. I wish it turns out to be a great institute and like TIFR, more and more enlightened young people like to join it.</p>

<p>For me, I am planning to stay at IMSc for doctorate (if I could control my not-so-sensible tounge in interview). Here I was chatting with a professors and he passed a comment, "Look son! 5 year is not a small time, After 5 year no-body is going to give you a job after doing physics and more importantly you will be ostracised by the very people who praises your logo (IIT on my T-shirt) you are having on your back. Thought it through. Physics does not guarantee success to anyone no matter how smart or intelligent. Just talk to the students here before making a dedication." I just nodded and smiled back then He took his coffee cup and wished me good-luck for the interview.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>In 1943, there was a famine in Bengal, though the total grain available was higher than that of 2001 (if Amartya Sen is to be believed). Then why in 1943, 3 million indian perished. Sen argued that the impression (rumour) of the shortage of grain made the price higher than ever before even though there was not a crop failure. And the government did not stop exporting the rice (British and free market champions were at the government of course, as we got today), it still remain a mystery how come so called intellectual at that time failed to curb it. They just did not care or they liked poor people dying out. Or perhaps Raj was wrong why famine occurs. You know what is most remarkable all about this.. In 1943, per capita availability of food grain was 147.5 kg, which is now 141.7 kg!! Still G. W. Bush was blaming Indians and Chinese for the skyrocketting the food prices. The stupid NYTimes joined the debate too. While nobody explains why only for that 2 weeks Indian and Chinese starts eating so much that beat the shit out of the US.</p>

<p>In India, which is shining (at least on the campuses of IITs, IIMs, ISB..) more than 770 million people lives below Rs. 20 a day. The state-run National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector (NCEUS) said most of those living on below Rs 20 per day were from the informal labour sector with no job or social security, living in abject poverty. Data is there on its website on the very first page, you dont have to take the pain exploring it. While the richest 10 in india own 30% of her GDP, bottom 20% consumes 1.22% of all recourses.</p>

<p>'Survival of the fittest' perhaps is the most misunderstood by the students. It is used to justify most of the social evil. Darwin theory make sense when the time-line is expanded over the million years. As human, we may not survive! Perhaps the indication is here. The UN habitat report says that by the year 2030, 30% of the population will live in the urban slums.</p>

<p>Sensex, sensitive index of misery! When tsunami struck, all the nations (who have anything like major stock markets) suffered the colossal seen a strange phenomenon. All five nations stock market (Thailand, Indonesia, india, Srilanka, ...) reahched their highest point. why? may be because poors does not matter to the stock market but why the stock market ran out of roof. It would have been fathomable if they remained teh same. No, but they rise like a hell. Reason, Money pouring in as aid. or say dogs on the dalal street smell the meet. They still running non profit organisation.. "75 cents can save a child'..While when 60 million voters tured down so called "india shining"  government defying all the pundits of news channel, Newspapers; the sensex collapsed. It can not stand the happiness of the most of the have-nots.  This is woderful thing about indian democracry, poor people vote and they are the only people who should. Else can protect their interests by themselves.</p>

<p>In Gujrat earthquake, most of the relief money spend by thses NGO was building the temp controlled tents for the foreigners while the victim were dying out there in cold. This time government refused to allow foreign NGO's. TOI went scathing. Its turn out to be that the local NGO were far better at handling the crisis.</p>

<p>While tsunami did a phenomenal destruction, Maharashtra government destroyed the 80000 homes in mumbai slum (larger than tsunami). they were not even allowed to take out their possesions, it was to make sure they wont retunrn. Since the incident was toobig to avoid, how much media coverage we saw in the leading newspapers. Indian Express was as shameless and Shiv Sena. The drivers of bulldozers and constable \s interviews were killed in the newsroom beacause they dont serve the interests of the elites. Elites of mumbai went to High court seeking that these slum dweller should not be allowed to vote since they are depressed. If Arundhati Roy day that India as a democracy (or most of the nations as democracy) are the biggest PR scam of this century, it seems justifiable (if you are also emotionaly charged). India ranks 105 out of 125 nations on hunger index, but western media still now portrays it as tiger economy (thats a different story that our tiger is also in vanishing fast). We are more hungry than ever before, more hungry than Ethiopia. But all praise is showered on us, why beacause we are doing what we were suppose to do, we opened our market to capitalist, destroyed rural supply chain. Forced the farmers to commit suicides. Some argued they commit suicide because they used to drink, if alcohol drives people to commit suicide, 99% engineers would have committed suicide by now. In 30 minutes, a farmer commit suicide in India! 225 journalist covered lakme fashion week in which models were showing same clothes made by cotton, while not a 100 miles away, women, men, girls and boys were committing suicided. They grew cotton. Not a single newspaper seen the link among Indian Beautiful and just Indian and cotton. The news that time could have made an impact. But corporate mass media is .... i cant find the words. You can search youtube for P. Sainath and you dont have to listen to or read anyone.</p>

<p>Personally, I feel the pain. I lived in the village where still no electricity. Farmers still haev to pay 24% interest rate if they want to buy tractors or cultivator while for cars its only about 8%. Our land is considered cheap at it means nothing to bank until unless SEZ does not devour it. In this year budget, when goverment allocate more budget to NREGA, rich in white collors scorns since it does not serve their purpose.</p>

<p>When the food prices were higher, the intellectual were saying, see this gonna help the farmers." Did they know that 88% of farmers are net buyers since their farmland (crop they grow) does not support their family need? The farmers in India are total buyers. We are surplus nation because we dont let our farmers eat. We destroyed the public distribution systems. Not only in India, In US farmer commits suicide a lot. Since well wishers dont want to deny them their insurance, they made it accident. Government is happy as long as there is no stigma. Food security worlwide is declining.In the meantime AP government was happy exporting the wheat at the rate of 5.71 while the same government sells it at 6.45 in AP. In my place, we grow paddy and wheat, at the end of the day we can eat it. But corn and cotton are not digestible. Anyway this  could be a long stories. I am alreay feeling hungry.</p>

<p>When Rome was burning, Nero was playing flute.. Anyway, I am more interested in Nero grand party in which he invited everyone who matters anything to Rome. In this party there was a problem, it was dark so they wanted to lighten it up. So Nero decided to burn the prisoners. They made human torch and burn the prisoners all over the place so there can be light. I am not at all interested in Nero. But who was his guests? All intellectuals and great great roman,,, champions of so many things.  What kind of mentallity they had? Eating beans as a human is thrown into the flames.</p>

<p>Well in this world of Inequalities, We can refused to be Nero's guests!!</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>This is March 25, 2009. Today I started writing these memories.</p>

<p>Though I write my diary, I am writing this on the blog. I may loose my diary. There is a big danger for that mortal thing to be consumed by something. These blogs I can preserve easily until unless holocaust does not happen or I loose my memory completely.</p>

<p>It would be nice today writing about all the 23 years I've lived. It would be sensible to figure out if this living made any sense till now.</p>

<p>I don't remember much about my childhood. Or perhaps there is nothing much to remember. My childhood, mostly, was of a typical rural kid. Waking up before the sunrise and sleeping just after the sunset.  Mummy tells me about my childhood though. Like I used to be quite alone. Never played with the kids of my age. If guest would come to visit us, I'd sit somewhere and watch them in surprise. Mingling with the older men was the thing I did quite often. Their knowledge surprised  me. And I got this desire to grow up to be a cool old dude.</p>

<p>Paper was scarce at my home since this was of no use. So did the pen. Mummy could hardly read. Dad spends most of the time in the fields. No time for him to blacken the paper. Anyway, there was a big register in which Papa kept the accounts of the important dates, like at which date the particular cow or buffalo suppose to give birth to a calf, and at which date the bill from sugar mill came, and if someone asked for some money or things, that was also noted down too. There were some books at my home, mostly used by my father during his stunts in his schooldays. In his school, as He recalls, He'd dump his schoolbag somewhere under the bridge on the canal and go to fields to track down some wild birds like titar with his friend. Most of his friends were from lower castes (It was an terrible thing to do in those days). Today, back at my place things are far better that they are here. He used to make animals out of clay. Others say that He was quite an artist. Once he and his friends stole the mitti (clay used to make pot) from the kumhaar (potter) and made a tractor. Quite a big one. They would sit on it and pull it on the roof. It had steerings and wheels. It could be steered using steering. Everyone was surprised. Even the potter would not say anything. Once in monsoon, in night, rain! and all gone! His grown up friends still recalls that tractor was a remarkable incident in their life and regrets that they should have salvage it in the night itself from the rain. He studied till highschool. Failed in highscool miserable. Passed in only one subject (37/100, 33 was the passing marks) out of six. I lost his marksheet. He passed it in second attempt as He'd say, I am skeptical though. My grandfather was quite literate given the time He lived in. That is perhaps He let him go to the school. I used to have his handwritten application to the  Bank manager in which he requested him to shut down the account. It contained Rs 33.50. There was not a big use of account though that time as it does today. Gradpa was a very big spendthrift.  That pays off later. He bought some more lands and bought my father his first tractor (Rs 85,000, Eicher ). Meanwhile my father got married while he was in 11th standard. 19 year old, or perhaps 18. Mummy was 16. My nanaji was quite a rich farmer. He used to have hundreds of cows and a lot of lands. His had 2 sons. Bade mamaji did graduation and did not do a job. After the education He couldn't do the farming. This is the foremost reason why did farmers did not like their children to be educated. Even when we were in the schools, some would come a say, " Look! dont send them to the school too often, they become useless for khetibaari. You should teach them how to work in the fields." And my father listened to them. Working in the field was the primary choices we were given. However, I dont know why, schooling were never terminated or depreciated. Perhaps, my mother was hell bent. And why woudn't Dad listen to a lady who the most beautiful lady in the whole village (or perhaps in the world! mind you, check out my "Family Album" in orkut). Anyway, later after highschool, we were not asked to do works in the fields, though small small works were time consuming but not laborious like staying on the field while irrigating it if Dad had some other works. Suppling Diesel for the engine and lunch for the workers. Bringing fodder from the fields for the cattles. Studying engineering, was thing that could happen in the dreams those days. Pass the intermediate and look out for some work or go to the nearest degree college for UG and start working on the fields. Ultimately, You have to be a farmer! Fortunately, it did not happen that way. :)</p>

<p>I was quite smart in my childhood. I did learn alphabets and elementary math way too fast. I used to write in the air or sand. I used to suffer from unlimited imagination and so find very hard to concentrate on what someone else had to say in the class. By someone I mean teacher, other were not allowed to talk in the class. Indian society, at large is quite oppressive. I was fortunate to have a teacher like Shri Shivprakash Sharma. Every kid in the school liked him.</p>

<p>In primary school, In which we studied, is in my village. A new building of 2 rooms and a small office was just erected out. It looks really nice. There was a library in which 257 books (all names were put down in registers) were there. They were of all kind. By all kind means lit, science, math and blah blah. I read all of them :-). That was the place, I got all the inspiration and attitude needed to do somehing valuable. Though it was a messed up school but I had a nice teacher, Shri Shivprakash Sharma. Since then, I have seen great professors, researches, persons.. but as a teacher none matches Him. Teachers and mothers all we need to shine like a wonderful society/nation/human beings.</p>

<p>HOME, FAMILY AND PRIMARY SCHOOL<br/>
When I joined the school, there was a urgent need for the clock since we did not had any. I still counts how many clock a place have when I visit it, childhood curiosity do not die! Dad wouldn't give a damn about not having a clock. For him it was useless. Sun shines, go to fields. When temperature in unbearable, come back. When birds starts chattering again in evening, go to the fields. And of course everything ceased to exists when sun went down. Mummy marked the ground on the floor. When sunlight touches the spot it was time get the bath and to get ready...  and school chale hum... Later Mummy went to her mother's place and bought a clock for Rs 75 (She also bought a lot of Parle-G and orange flavor toffees :), more important than the watch ) . What a utter waste of money, my father would say. But he didn't make it a big deal out of it since the money came from my mother side. Or perhaps he also liked to see the ticky tick in the home. My mother taught me how to see the time in the watch. Perhaps that was all she could teach me. She studied till 4th standard. She knew that time how to read. Now she seems to forget a lot of it. She would say, "See, I am the most educated person, I made all of my kids educated. One is Engineer, One is pharmacist (she couldn't pronounce it properly, She'd say only B. Pharma.) and One is a M.Sc. (she wouldn't sat Chemist. She does not know what it is anyway!). She fast a lot and very religious kind of lady. Navratra, Karvachoth, every thrusday, friday .. poornima, amavasya.. a lot of fasting. She loves watching television. With us, walt disney. Pluto is her favorites. Silly symphonies takes the second spot. Since the television was B/W (no electricity for a colored one those days, these days ok! inverter would do but TV is still not there. Dad does not like it and Doordarshan does not air Walt Disney anymore.) Saas-Bahu serials are plenty on tv, that is why none of bother to have a tv in home. She does not care anyway. She is happy with the cows and their calves. total 14. All stupid!</p>

<p>My gradma, unsurprisingly is total illiterate. Her views of the world are hilarious, ridiculous, naive and at the same time very emotional. She lived in total poverty. She is in her nervous nineties,   or perhaps might have crossed the century marks. In her mouth, the foundation of her teeth are still secure. her teeth are sharp. All 32 are still intact, not in the proper shape though. In the morning first thing she would do is to curse the chattering birds. She would use all her imagination to figure out all the antiques gaali to curse them. She believes that these cattles, birds, dogs understands what a human say but could not speak. She would ask to turn off the radio in the night so that the RJ could sleep. She still wonders how much persons in the television does not feel the heat while she is sweating. I explained that to her though but she did not seem to be convinced. She does not know what the difference between Rs 10, Rs 50 and Rs 100 note. She only knows the coins. Rs 1, 2 and 5. More than that is beyond her very imagination. Paper bills are big. In her prime time, she only seen aane. Children were as fragile as a clay toy those days. 7 of her child took away by death. Only my father and 3 daughters of her survived. Doctors were scare. Today we have a doctor in our village, not a degree holder but quite good. He can not treat cancer or heartattack, anyway nobody get those things. Only headache, stomach related diseases, fever. You can go to nearby town if situation id bad. Granny does not know what I am doing. All she cares about that I should get married to beautiful girl, more beautiful than my mother was. Life in her time deserves a new blog. I'll write it later.</p>

<p>My elder brother used to study at my mausaji place. And my younger brother did not give a damn. I did not know that he is my eleder brither whenever he'd come back. Since I was smart as I told u.. I could figure out that is the missing sibling of our poor little family. He did not like it there, and I did not like him when he permanently came back. He was a damn bully. My yonger brother used to be constantly sick so He wouldnt dare to touch him. Anything could have proved fatal to him. So I was a only target he could have. A fat little boy at his mercy.</p>

<p>He used to tell us wonderfull facts. Like "Apun is the strongest man in the whole world, whoever names is Apun would grow up to as strong as him" Then he declared himself Apun. My younger brother was so impressed that he made a pact with him. Now i got two kids to handle.. One was my bully brother and other was chidchida brother. Somehow they discovered a formula to make potions which has the potential to convert them into the allmighty beasts. After much deliberation, they allowed me to taste it, afterall I was their brother and ofcourse Mummy was there so they didnt make it a big deal. Anyway a sip wouldn't make me that strong. So they did not see a threat in that. The taste was strange and I did not feel anything. But somehow, After drinking that they become stronger. I knew they did. They proved it on me.</p>

<p>After this, they wouldn't do that for I'd start crying. They day was won easily by tears. Anyway we were learning at schools and were gud at learnign things. So my elder brother came up with a new fact. he had a some kind of wood which had some unusual shape. He'd say, " See, if I put it underground. Then after seven layers of cowdung over it in seven years, it'd finally become a sparrow. Then I'd flow away and shit into this hole. The shit will be golden." That was an impressive story. So we did that. None of us did check the shit after 7 year anyway. So the truthfulness of the fact can not be refuted.</p>

<p>... to be continued....</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Do all of them have anything in common, think!! No.?</p>

<p>There have been a lot of debate in media about reservations and all other related things. I dont want to talk about what is good or bad for others. The other topic 'love' has nothing to do with cast here in particular, its the time we are living in gives a interesting relation with them.</p>

<p>Lets take love first, since most of the teenagers think about it a lot in some way or other. I am not going to be philosophical here. We only like to considers the aspects which we shows each other during romance. (Interestingly people have this problem "she/he does not understands me. I am different. She/He does not understand it. Dude! you are as good as you behave. Inside you are as good as Ram/Sita, I dont give a damn. Its your behaviors that I can understand not your intentions.)  Anyway, the economy is progressing, the reeks or professionalism is coming into our personal life, the justification of meeting ends by any means is being approved by the youth. Professionalism comes with a lot of problems. After rapid industrialization, there was a need to make the workers think in same way. Here in this white collar world, since we are good at hijacking the language, we use professional instead of calling ourselves laborer. It sound nice, media supports it. We write books about it extolling its virtue. Its a conspiracy hatched by some eminent businessman to make  so called educated person "submissive". Give this tag of 'professional' and force them to do what we like. Money comes a adhesive and/or motivational factor. Most of the companies can not stand individual creativity. The need to make all of them think for them needs an appealing concepts. So they came up with "profession". It kills the joys in life. We left love, ok! So do you want to be in a relationship? No thanks! I am concentrating on my career.  Fair enough! What about when you are on the job? No thanks, I am concentrating on my career. Is that too hard to keep the professional and personal life advancing together? How come having a relationship can hamper your other part of life? Ok, you did not have nice experience with the last relationship. it was all foolish. So what to worry about it! it hurts! chuck it! hard though but doing it not impossible. You dont want to get committed its early, you dont want hanging around with someone without having a relationship either. Homo sapience are amazing. No other species have that much complication. Are we stuck in between having a casual relationship and soulmate hunting? or The professionalism is extending itself over to our emotional horizon too. No body would deny staying alone sucks! Even darwin couldn't resist it!</p>

<p>I dont want to comment about cast. So what is the relationship among them. Really nothing!</p>

<p>Consider this.. Love, profession and Cast are handling modernity really well, its the modernity who does not have a freaking idea what to do with them?</p>

<p>Perhaps changes are coming really fast in out life. I am afraid that as a society we are not ready for them. Rising intolerance around the world is alarming!</p>

<p>Hey, last point. Everyone who roams around in India wonders what keeping it together with so much of diversity. A system is stable in nature when either it is perfect or completly chaotic. Our diversity is so much and it is very near to chaos. Even though We Indians hate each other, we can not focus our hate-enegry on someone specific. We are blessed to be able to hate 999 out of 1000 person we meet. So little time, so many to hate. Oh man! give us a break.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>I came about to read about a wonderful engineer of 18th century.. a british engineer named Isamard Kingdom Brunnel who designed great western railways and other super blah blah things. In addition He used to smoke 40 cigars a day and died by a stroke. Too much for a genius. This blog has nothing to do with him or his's. From his accounts its seems that in 18th centuries, engineers were seen as people who change the world. Things have changed a lot since then, as Jack Ganssale points out in his  "The art of desiging embedded systems". Engineers work hard till their ass starts sweating but think less (its where your underwear plays more important role that AC in your workplace. Hey this could be worth researching how the thermodynamics works at the interface of your butt and chair cushion).<br/>
A study by Tim DeMacro and Tim Lister showed that keeping other things equal, a programmer with 6 months or one year or 10 year of experience have same efficienty when it comes to writing codes. That is bit alarming! We design a lot of complex systems but have less understanding. Some company took benefits of this sheer dumbness (or indifference) of engineers. Debuggers are most obvious among them. They capitalize on this inefficient and easily avoided practices of engineers.<br/>
Gallager, in his speech at IIT B here, cracked jokes about this attitude too. microsoft word is getting bigger and bigger every day and gives more headache than ever before (thanks to TEX who saved the eyes of millions). He was insisting that we, engineers should keep things simple (if I get him right!). Even when the final outcome is complex, it can be build upon by these simple blocks which would be easy to manage, modify and debug.</p>

<p>Most interesting thing about engineers is, they are omnipresent. There is joke, "If you throw a stone in a street of bangalore, It will hit a dog or an software engineer." They can be as young as 12 year to as old as a dead person could be. Other professions generally keeps armatures out (for better or worse i dont know), take doctors for instance. Is the meaning of word engineer cheapened over the time? In 18th century they were considered celebrities, "the architect of futures". Are we only reduced to "B.Tech/B.E." today only?  There were times when politicians were considered in very high-esteem. During the Raj in India or take other worldwide struggle for Democracy. Now, as Democracy has become Damn-0-Crisis (the bad among the worst), there are politicians at every streets, just like engineers in every fields. Engineer, sound glamorous, Haan! Now politicians took away the meaning of trust, (Raju did the same with Satyam). Are we destroying our own profession. There are engineers who cant even implement Ohm law. Are We only reduced to doing some job?  Say, writing codes, programmer! Any idiot can write codes, any one can play around with softwares to make something. What separates us from hackers and amateurs? This I may find out later. Anyway, There are very few words/concepts with are as misused/misunderstood as engineers; some of them could be, "freedom of speech", "national interest", "laws and rights", "politics", "democracy", "its not our culture (drinking in NOT but beating girls IS)", "son of the soil (new addition)".. you are welcome to extend the list.</p>

<p>There are other examples too. Microsoft had to make patch for its Internet Explorer in dec 2008. IE is not someting very new, still they all screwed up. Take windows, you all are aware of this blue monster. If you are not, use Linux then you will know how monstrous it is. Same is with .doc Vs .tex.</p>

<p>Still, I can say, We Indians, might not be good with the research but we certainly are the best engineer in the world (please don't include the BPO and call-centre). Perhaps, Its a bit hard statement. Wheather its embedded technologies developed by DRDO, nuclear technologies from DAE/BARC, not to mention ISRO achievements, they are all worldclass. Hopefully one day, even quality will be judged as "indian class". It can be defined as performance*reliablity to cost ratio. Lets check it out after 20 years or so!! too much for today.. I have to finish "SOUTHPARK season 6").</p>

<hr />

<p>Uff.. this is the placement time. First phase is over and I am jobless. I wrote all the tests and gave all the stupid interviews. Interviews, to those guys ..  I dont like them. Neither I want to be like them.. They asked all the standard and diplomatic question and I answered all honestly. Not with complete honesty.. otherwise they'd have thrown me out. But I want a job.. well paid so I can pay back my load asap and go on to do my doctorate. Now, it seems It may take 2 years to pay back it.. and I am tense.. First I have to do the things I dont like. Now GATE is valid only for 1 year. This year score wont work next year.. what a crap!!</p>

<p>I dont like giving exams and the worst is giving interviews to the people I dont wanna be. What a stupid life.. Due to all of these, I didnt write TIFR exam for doctorate. :-(</p>

<p>Now mamma is insisting joining DRDO/ISRO and dad is whatever is respectful. Younger brother wants to me to join the highest paid one and my elder brother wants me to know my girlfriend name. hmmmmm..</p>

<p>Tomorrow one more test and interview.. ahh.. I dont want to go.. Ok.. I have to be.. though I have choices but I am not comfortable to make them.. I have to go for a job. After I am done with the loan .. :-) I dont give a damn.. what anyone thinks .. anyone means my family.. others do not matter !!</p>

<p>ok.. blah blah is over.. Its took me 20 years to kill the inferior feelings. Now after this placement spree, this has started germinating once again. I dont want it. Its really harmful!! gotta protect myself!! :-) lets see....</p>

<p>I am getting addicted to X-files and Ubuntu... linux is wonderful and Windows is as stupid.. hehe</p>

<p>Jyoti is wondering why i didn't get the job on the very first day. Boka was being boka.. telling why did I join IIT. Cancer is asking me to go to US for doctorate AS IT'D SOLVE ALL OF MY PROBS. good scholarship.. pay back my loan and all... I want to join TIFR,CMI or IMSc.. actually .. i wanna doctorate here.. Now I dont want to go anywhere. I consumed resources here, I'll compensate them too here. Its not patriotism or something. it's all belief. unfortunately, I have to be someone whom I never wanna be for a year or so. All I wish I dont lay off my eyes on the things I always wanted to have. These days I am not even writing my diary.. Things are bit disturbing these days. :-(</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Uff!! it is the reaction when i read a article in a national newspaper about rape and murder of british teenager Scarlette keeling on Anjuna beach in Goa. A slight amusement came out when I surf the british newspaper website to get the idea or their coverage of the issue..</p>

<p>They say we need more women in sensitive position to empower women. no doubt about it in general, they have been living in a male dominated society in which over the time they are being taken for granted. India has a pathetic record when it comes to gender inequalities or children malnutrition.. well, this is not about all this.. this particular episode have some travesty of this popular belief.</p>

<p>media is one of the sensitive place where there is significant numbers of women in sensitive position. From tv anchor to top notch journalist. The particular handling of this episode (tragedy) shows that merely having women journalist in place does not guarantees that gender politics will also fall in place. What seemed to be at work was the pretence of a populist concession to public concerns...</p>

<p>Someone is raped and murder, thats in general a very sensitive issue at least for those who cares about the world around them otherwise it just 80 year long life,, and philosophies like "I want to break free" and " live it to full extent" are taken in very wrong way. Every report on tv starts with the pictures of the bruised body of the victim so that the audience can be kept glued to their seats.. On talk shows and in media, some stupid questioned her mother sexual behaviour. We Indian love to find fault in everything, thats the gift we have, afterall we have a society which vastly differs, differences are obvious and we have criticla eyes! Ok back to the point.. Producers may argue, As to increase TRP on which familiar hook on which to peg the story? half of the story tells us to think about the image of the Goa which is already infused with dissent intertwined with the corrupt image of Politicians regarding SEZ and sexual behaviour of tourists. Where was the sensitivity to the gender issues in the whole damn coverage? Its not a issue to be discussed in tabloids between the pages depicting girls in bikini..   Somewhre, in parallel to someone's death and rape .. death and rape of the Goa were used.. Do we have any sensitivity for anyone who is got into the problematic situation but refused to play victim, well thats not the case in particular here!</p>

<p>There were negative sensitivity though, highlighting her tatoos and her alternative lifestyle contributing her daughter death, producing details about her past sexual life. Media is becoming drama, Education is now training, rape and murder are being started justified indirectly, prostitution is not a problem now for some though the implications seems to be so serious for the society as a whole..</p>

<p>In the mean time .. Honourable State minister of maharashtra, pointing to the farmers suicide in the state, said that committing suicide is a crime, they should be grateful that I am not filing a case against them. While Chief Justice of India yesterday said- "Chief Justice of India is not a public servant but a constitutional authority.".. What made them think so is not clear, pressure of work or just an innocent observation...</p>

<p>things are not going well around us!</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>I exactly dont remember when i first met him. He was in Production Eng. Dept and I was in Instrumentation. We used to be live on the same floor in first year of our graduation. When we started talking and became friend, i have no idea. But by the end of the first year we were nice friends.</p>

<p>He was a tall guy, slim, but used to gave a 'O' in his stomach. Generally attired in formals. We used to discuss old time movies stars along with other roommates. Last three years was not as much intractive. Ours dept were different so we used to have classes at different places. Whenever we used to meet each other, He used to start overreacting and all. Tried to cracks jokes and used to poke me in my stomach. On his jokes, i had to pass comments and he liked that.</p>

<p>I dont have many friends. Indeed I am left with no one around these days. Loosing a friend like is a disappointment. But the better side is, If I die tomorrow and goes to the somewhere where he went, i know I'll be having a nice man over there to whom I can talk all day and night long... we talked to laugh.. to enjoy... to live the moments.. We'll do it over there too...<br/>
You were a nice man Papi.. (that what we used to call him..)<br/>
:-)<br/>
cheers..</p>

<p>dj -- thats what he used to call me.....</p>

<p>PS: Take care of your hair, you were loosing them when you was here. hey dude, may be you can visit me sometime if possible, dont worry I wont hurt you!! :-)</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Its April 25, 2008... 2320 hrs IST...IIT bombay elec. dept. PC lab..............</p>

<p>Semester is over and holidays are around. Feeling free today!! Most of my friends  have left Mumbai by now or will leave is a day or two. I have to be here till may 22. These days I am loving math and realising why they say "Ignorance is bliss"... more you know and you have a curious mind.. u are doomed!! cant remain normal. it just not natural.</p>

<p>Ok! lets track back to the primary school days.. those days were the most remarkable of all.. I love government school primary system... till class 3 you have only 3 buks.. in 4 they are 5 and in fifth class, u get 7 buks to study.. very thin.. very less work.. njoy!! Sri Shivprakash Sharma was the teacher then, he is a wonderful man.. a teacher with a vision.. he indirectly shaped me in certain ways.. I loved our library there.. that was a small one.. have only about 200 buks.. i read them all in less then a week.. generally all the money which comes for the school development was eaten by the corrupt headman and his puppets. Who give a damn to education but buks were useless to them, however i appreciate that they did not sell it as "trash" just for some more money or may be Shivprakash Sir did not let them to do so. Those five years, i used to be perfect student.. just like IIT logo says "gyanam parmam dhayeyam".. no stupid competition, no  forced expectation.. what else you can ask from a society.. fortunately, in my family there was a strong appreciation for education rather than marks or "training" which i am getting today. those were remarkable days. I still have my all buks and notebuks preserved!! :-)</p>

<p>then came high school.. first time, expectation arose, competition began! Those were the nasty days.. I lived only three moments mostly.. one read according to the syllabus, dont doubt,  didnt get something - mug up!! In other word it is called preparing for exams. second write the exams.. it didnt hurt much, that was only 3 hours.. though it feels like Nazi concentration camp these days but it was ok then.. children are not so critical!! third wait for results and do nothing.. pathetic!! in one you do mindless labour or i'd say "intellectual child labour" which gives you a knowledge which same so many patches and holes that the wonderful ideas which are generally liquid just cant stay in there, leave alone being developed!  SECOND,it is not a long time, only 3 hours.. ok.. THIRD is results which gives you superficial and stupid  pride in your abilities..</p>

<p>upto intermediate I continued in the same way. only positive point was i never took any kind of coaching, i study all the things by myself, otherwise things would be worse by now!   nyway.. after a break engineering started. after a year or so i just stopped worrying about curriculum and  exams.. if u get in to a bad college that is the good thing,, u can pass the stupid courses even u do nothing.. hehehe..</p>

<p>i have realised that learning is tough, unlearning something bad or wrong u have learned is tougher but realizing it is the toughest... the good things is the things are getting clearer now.. [:)]</p>

<p>on the other hand I am getting very much self indulgent, dreaming about all the good things to come and enjoy them daydreaming..  i feel really good.. time will tell if it is good or bad!</p>

<p>Sometimes One has dreams which only one can see. generally, people try to take it away or hinder it unintentionally, u see, any system does not appreciate different approach, it creates trouble for entities in authority and none gives a damn about individuals. Ok, lot of whining!! Everyone feels it at some point or other. These dreams gives satisfaction, success and values may not ensue. One retaliate if being suppressed.. loose one's energy and starts loving solitude.. I am lucky in that way.. Prof Sharma understands it! He just give me precautions.. like.. "make it look like related with engineering" "tumhara external examiner tumhari watt laga dega".. When it comes to routine exams, watt to lagni hai meri, i know.. :-)</p>

<p>its lunch time.. gotta go.. my rummate is waiting for the lan..</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>This is my third profile on orkut, I deleted my previous ones and again and again tempted to make new one. Kind of situation i always find myself in and don't understand why i fool myself. Now, I have to be honest and lets try to track back.. orkut was first introduced to me by my classmates.. stupid things, why should i join? Till 3rd year of my b.tech i kept myself away from it. Then I joined in. It was a novelty and i was loving it. I never have problems getting addictive to novelties, somehow it helps learning. First, I started adding all of my classmates and then hey, lets compete with room mates in scrap numbers. Everything seems to be fine!!</p>

<p>After half a year, i started realizing that these so called social networking websites making me more reclusive. I am not going out with rummates, not interacting much with people. Who cares.. addiction is still here!!</p>

<p>What disillusioned me that most of the person i knew offline behaved differently online. Seems like that they like to do things on these sites they cant do offline and thus its making them feel better. Does it cause addiction to these sites? However, leaving obvious different gender conversation ( They dont change much wheather online or offline) and all flirting, what else could be matter of giving so much time to these sites which eventually facilitate a secondary personality online? The subject which used to be the forte of experts to discuss about, now every Tom, Dick, Harry and Dilawar can comment on, and wow it really feels good. :-)</p>

<p>Sigmund Freud argues, that in every individual the very basic thing which prompts his or her actions is to prove his/her importance. Quite true seems to be to me. Well, that definition needs bit elaboration but leave it... Pompously written testimonials, very best of the photographs in albums, no of friends, joined communities ( i love soccer, though i never played it ever) seem to be going well with Freud's argument.  Looks like on these psychologies these social networking site are capitalizing on. One more personal point, whoever i met after first having conversation online, He/She turned out to be a very different from what i PERCEIVED him/her to be. Well its not their faults ofcourse, might be this is the problem with online communication at which u cant figure out the gestures which says more about the person that his/her words do.</p>

<p>Well for me, joining orkut again and again was (as it seems to be) lacking friends to talk to in real world and I dont blame anybody. Its all with me, my kind of talking, sense of humour, hardly very few people can stand. Seems like i m not born compatible to the general public. But i have some really good friends ( and they told it to me) but they are not around these days and I cant talk with myself every time ( danger: being known as a restarted ). However, this is good too, sometimes it really good to be on orkut. Easy to find people to like to date with :-) ( but takes a lot of time and wastage), no matter if it turns out to be disaster, anyway if u are not interested in arrange marriage you should give a chance to everyone (of-course indirectly so everytime u can bail out if things are not going well) so that u dont regret it later. I cant find any other reasons worth sticking to these sites. And temptations in this age especially when you are single is so high and very very hard to resist!!!! Anyway one does what one likes especially on these sites, thats why we love them. There are lot of restriction which and monstrous in offline, stupid system to follow, social structures to abide to, imposed responsibilities to adhere to, aggressive society which want you to be the victim of its conformity. All relieved when you are online.. :) .... If you dont have the courage to do what you like offline, i bet u stay online.... Keep in mind next time u login... and i try to remember all this i just said.. but what to do with temptations... ha???</p>

<p>Ever wonder why I am writing all this online!! told you na .. proving importance!!</p>

We have a lot of confusions in our mind, though we understands what are we doing, but sometimes its really hard to convince yourself that what you are doing will lead to the ultimate aim of your life. Thanks to Prof. Narayanan, today in his lecture, the way He addressed the class, in a flash i felt so light. Now on He is the one who will always be on the page no 19 of my diary along with two more people ( one is my father and other is My Primary School Teacher).  Today I felt like that I m still 4 year olds trying to factorize the numbers.<br/>
I always respect persons with self-satisfaction. I admire them most and respect them to the bottom of my heart. Now I am 21year old, at this time, I don't remember any stupid exams, any instances of winning medals, any ranks, marks... all I remember that how it felt. How wonderful was the moment when I predicted the time using our Sundial which i constructed when i was in Primary School, How I used to roam around into the fields just to collect the leaf samples.<br/>
I respect my inner self, it always help me to find out the solution whenever I was in dilemma, and most of the time it was good, though on some occasion it  turned out to be embarrassing. There are lot of deeds I did when I was a child which hurt me today, I should have not missed the drawing pictures just to excel in science. I should have learned how to play flute. But It still not late. I'll do it now. And thats the promise I made to myself long ago. Just wishing I continue tha same way as I am thinking.. Anyway If it makes you feel good, it can't be that bad!!</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>The book "Submodular Network and Circuit Analysis" written by Prof. H. Narayanan of Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India have a thought just before the 'preface' page. It says "Learning is a shore-less sea; the learner's days are few; Prolonged study is beset with a thousand ills; With clear discrimination learn what's meet for you; Like swan that leaves the water, drinks the milk." Now just to emphasis "Learning is a shoreless sea". True but disgusting! what was on the minds of this human  race who piles up so many  knowledge on the heap already so much vast to be embraced by the thoughts even by the most eligible person. About 80 years of lifetime, so much to know. Why did we create such a system which wants us to discriminate knowledges. I am of belief, as a student along with the some philosophers the the most basic understanding  of the universe (which contain everything, some would say Nature) should be developed which would take a reasonable time to imbibe and that can facilitate furthur reasoning to answer out the questions.   Wasting time learning what has already been learnt is kind of absurd thing to do. Though some would say that is how you can make yourself a expert in a certain subject. This kind of assertion are really stupid. Just ask a person who has devoted his/her whole life on a single subject, what would be his/her response? For me it is still a open question. I हवें't ask anybody. if u do plz let me know.</p>

<p>What should be the aim of our knowledge? It is just not a philosophical question. Assume i am a कhip designer, have a vast knowledge about silicon chip. What is the significance, when hardly 0.001% people on the earth uses these product. Once the technology saturates after reaching a physical limit, this knowledge becomes useless. My point here is, i have a knowledge which is rigid, has an application only in a specific area, its useless. Anyone, even a machine can be programmed to do that job. I want a knowledge which i can use at every going-ons of my life. Ofcouse these days knowledge created by engineering, medicine, managements etc helps you earn money and hence arguably better life. Just leave this money thing out of the subject, now consider what would you like to learn.You are asking me, i dont know! i am thinking. May be, some kind of philosophy would give the answer.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Ever wonder why we are not advancing in the direction of fundamental discoveries. Most of the basic concepts we are imbibing are well established.  Whatever i have studied till now, i dont think there is any fundamental breakthrough made in this century. Yes we have done a lot in technology but that is the application of thoughts/theories. And it seems to be the these days that applications (technology) are influencing the basic research.<br/>
Personally, i feel before this century or rather before the advent of printing press, world was obviously isolated and of course most of the researchers was not in touch with each other. What they think, they premises new theories on them. Most of the thoughts were of course original and hence new to other thinkers. Their thinking was not subjugated to what books told them.  When they get published , they influenced  others and hence helped them improving and liberating their ideas.  Early childhood of those great thinkers must have been spent without books. Books, here mean, a well defined literature published over a significant area. I do not mean notes in any bounded form given by they teacher, they must be called notes. I do not if i am right, just a thought.  Whatever they learned must have been carrying the impression that that is not absolute. Now these days mostly and  indirectly, these books insist that whatever they are having blackened on them are absolute. unfortunately most of the authors write their books in that sense only that whatever is knew can not be replaced with alternatives. The examination system is making these things worse by disseminating these kind of thought among children. Do you really think the problem they ask in exams can be solved only in the way they taught in the class? i dont think so! this should not happen. How much foolish it may seem, new approaches must be appreciated. I know i am not convincing enough, but these 26 letters i dont find enough to explain everything. A universal language should be constructed which deliver the same essence of you, no matter written or spoken or whatever. If you have ever did chat on internet, u must have felt it that a same sentence may have totally different meaning in online and offline world. Emotions or rather gestures must not facilitate the subject to decipher the meaning of worlds being spoken, there must be a certainty of meaning irrespective of other things.  Well, i'll improve this blog later, thats the idea just came in. I wrote it so i dont forget it. C u all later...</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>A question is cropped up!</p>

<p>Is that due to pride and vanity that I do not believe in the existence of an omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient God? Though it doesn't make any sense whatever i say but these days as people have started taken me a little bit seriously, I should make my stand clear. This question is, I suppose, is inclined to conclude from the brief acquaintanceship they had with me, that it was too much on my part to deny the very existence of God and that I am suffering from the vanity and my mind is polluted by success (as some/most of the people believe that getting some fucking rank in some sort of competition is success.).</p>

<p>I deny the very sort of almighty God existence. I’ll advance my arguments later on. Here, I want to admit that it not vanity that has actuated my dis-belief and made me adopt the doctrine of atheism. Why should I have the vanity, I am not a super-being, supreme, neither a rival nor an incarnation. I must disprove this allegation. My atheism is not old. I started disbelieving in God and abhorring religion when I was obscure young man, sort of a “world class looser”, on which his classmates used to pass comments like rural-bumpkin, whose existence was not even noticed by the beggars on railway platform. Whose ability was even doubted by his mother, his father and his brothers ( I don't have a sister.. :-( ). I have never been a studious or laborious kind but committed towards my dreams. My kind of sophomore can not cherish any kind of sort of undue pride which may lead him to atheism. Though favorite of my engineering Math and engineering drawing teachers, I was always disliked and hated by other teachers. In my dept, the highest qualified and most experienced teacher, Prof. Dr. R. Thirumalai told me in transducer lab, ‘You could be bad, but your are the worst." A student who can not utter a single English sentence that time, though I always take pride my intermediate marks in Literature Hindi but hardly it could be the matter of pride outside my intermediate school, can not suffer from vanity especially in India whether your english is more important than your math or physics . I was rather a boy with a shy nature, who had certain pessimistic dispositions about his future career. And those days I was not a perfect atheist. My mother, under whose influence I was brought up used to fast almost 3 days in a week and everyday offers prayer. I was the only child in my village who, since the age of 4 till he passed 12th standard that is the age of 15 and a half, used to wake up in morning and after taking bath ( believe me it didn't matter if it was June or December, or I was fine or sick.), used to offer prayers in near by temple. That is also a irony, people in my village ascribe my success to my childhood worship and me, after developing total atheism got some sort of THING which most of the people call success. So when the seed of atheism is sown? it was a article that moved me highly. I didn’t have any argument to oppose his arguments. Then I think I should study. I began to study. After the improvement in my English, I started enjoying philosophy, more then the transducers and classical feedback control theory about which my room mate used to call me “control man”.</p>

<p>I believe (till now) that when you don’t have direct logic, then only you should turn to philosophy. Avoid philosophy as long as possible. There is very high danger that you might pick up very wrong philosophy depending on your logical abilities and your learning capabilities from observations. Don’t look for philosophy every time until the temptation to feel something is more than to know it. It is highly dangerous. Philosophy, as I believe, is the result of the weakness of human logical nature. There is almost every kind of philosophy present, confronting each other. You can justify any cause, any action, any any thing. When our ancestors have the leisure enough to try to solve the mystery of this world, its why and how, they were lacking direct proof, hence philosophy was born. Over the time it ossified into human mind as instincts and prejuidices and entrenched there. Though there are wide differences in the fundamentals of philosophies, even in a single hemisphere, just like religions, people are stick to them. They know both of them have nothing to offer other than a false sense of soothing nature, empathy, and above all and unfortunately, a belief to condone your wrongdoings invoking philosophy and religion.</p>

<p>Before going to argue about God, lets talk about religions which I dislike the most after Himmesh Reshamiya nasal singing. Well, we all know that the intentions of all religions are fair but the way they are executed have created the havoc around the globe. In India, take Gujrat pogroms, of internationally, say conflict in Somaliya, Chad, Rwanda are just a name of few. I believe that just to control the ordinary people from doing misadventures or PAAP they were made to fear the concept of God whose doctrine were set by religions. Nice concept, but unfortunately, it gives the power in some hands like churchs, Mosques, Temples, Akal Takht etc. To keep the power intact of privileged one rules were modified, and being modified. And we are so blind!</p>

<p>My previous faith underwent a remarkable change. Now my religion is Agnostic, I need a reason to believe. No more blind faith. The romance with violent faith were cut sort replaced by soothing Libertinism. Realism is my cult now. That what the people are calling vanity. The most important things in life are the clear conceptions of the ideals about which you would like to confront the whole world. After joining IIT, I got a very pleasing opportunity to study the various philosophies of various thinkers like Marx, Lenin, Trotsky, Derrida, Kristera, Lacan, Vivekanada, Premchand, Oskar Wilde…. Most of them were atheist. I studied Ramanujam, who in the later part of his life accepted that he did not believe in the existence of God. Dirac, on of my favorite physician was also agnostic/atheist. By the starting of 2006, I have convinced myself as to the baseless-ness of the theory that an almighty God has an existence creating, guiding, and controlling the universe. I have given out the very disbelief of mine, now I am a pronounced atheist. Religion is a very bad thing, it should leave unconditionally. Later we may miss it but in its current form, it is destroying the unity, debilitating the humanity.</p>

<p>Now, let me put my argument. Judgement is already well too known so I’ll try not to invoke philosophy here, only logic, otherwise you may say, “if you want to prove something wrong you will prove it anyhow with all the philosophies around.”</p>

<p>A Hindu might be expecting to reborn like a king or like a Prime Minister ( of course not like Manmohan Singh), a Muslim or a Christian might dream of luxuries to be enjoyed in paradise and the rewards for his suffering and scarifies -I do not have any idea about other religions ideologies so let me restrict myself within these boundaries. That would be enough- What am I to expect? After my last breath that will be my last moment, to be more precise, my soul as interpreted in metaphysical terminology shall all be finished there. A life of little bit of struggle, little bit of success, some tiny moments of happiness, and some wonderful memories to cherish, with no magnificent end shall in itself be a reward, if I have the courage, the valour to take it like that. Given the circumstances, My belief in God would have made my life easier, my burden lighter, and my disbelief in him would turn all the circumstances too rough, at least there would be somebody on Who I can put all the blame and walk away happily without hurting myself in anyway. But I don’t want the help of any intoxication to meet my fate. I don’t want my instincts to overpower my reasons. I am a realist and I am trying my best to perfect myself in that way. Though “I am whatever you say I am” for you but for me, I am a realist or trying to be one. I have not always been successful in accomplishing these ends. “But man duty to try and endeavour, success depends upon circumstances and environments,” golden words of Bhagat Singh.</p>

<p>There is an almighty, omnipotent and omnipresent God, who created this universe, please let me know why he created this universe? This world of woes and miseries, eternal combination of torture, murders, numberless tradegies: Not a single soul is perfectly satisfied. Don’t say its His law.If he is bound by any law, he is not omnipotent. He is just like you and me, another slave like ourselves. I am highly disillusioned that how could it be possible if God exists there is lot of injustice prevailing. Oh, don’t say He enjoys it. George W Bush is enjoying things in Iraq, Nero burnt down one Rome and to his enjoyment killed limited number of people, watch the movie “Gladiator”, see what people did for enjoyment. Do I need to write about Aurangjzeb and Chanjezkhan. Pages have been blacked with invectives diatribes condemning Nero, the tyrant, the heartless, the wicked. One Changezkhan killed a few thousands of people to seek pleasure in it and I abhor his very name. Then How will you justify your almighty, an eternal Nero, creating tragedies every second surpassing Changez every moment. Why did he create this world- a veritable hell, a place of constant and bitter unrest? Why did he create Man when he has all the power NOT doing so? Just to enjoy his tragedies. How mean and heartless could He be? Ok justice will prevail at last, that the innocent gets the justice at last! Would you forgive me if I dare to inflict wounds on your body and later try to put ointment on it.</p>

<p>My room mates used to warn me, don’t say bad words about God, He will hit you hard. Does your God seek vengeance? Oh! Plz don’t say yes. Then is worse then some the human beings. And if he just don’t care what you are doing, how much sense does it make to believe in someone who don’t even exists in your world.</p>

<p>Millions has died in Wars across the globe and still dying in the name of war against terror in Iraq, in tha name religion and caste as ethical cleansing in Somaliya, Rwanda, Kashmir; in the name of revolution by LTTE, Naxals, Bodo, and a lot of others. Hardly a second is passed in which a innocent soul is NOT tortures, murdered, devastated by means of the most inhuman ways. Why did He create such an animal, just to enjoy HIS art. What kind of asshole would He be Who enjoy tragedies. There are lot of pleasing things to enjoy, what could be more enjoying watching every soul prosper to its full extent enjoying innocently the gifts of nature.</p>

<p>You Mohammadans and Christians, I ask you what is your answer for the above mentioned questions. You don’t believe in previous birth so you cannot advance the argument of previous misdoings, like Hindus, as a reason of these sufferings. I ask you, why did your omnipotent God take 6 days to create this world and each day to say ‘all was well”? Call him today, you don’t have balance, use my mobile, show him the past history. Make him study the present and lets see if He dares to say – “All is Well”.</p>

<p>From the dungeons of prisons, from the stores of starvation consuming millions upon millions of human beings in slums and huts, from the exploited labourers, from the views of farmers committing suicide, patiently or say apathetically watching the procedure of their blood is being sucked by the capitalist vampires, and the utter wastage of human energy that makes my common sense shiver with horror, let Him see all of this and let him say, “All is well”. Why and wherefore? You are silent. Alright then I proceed.</p>

<p>Well, You Hindus, you say all the present sufferers belong to the class of previous birth. Good, and present oppressors were saintly people in their previous birth. In “Godan”, Premchand also criticize this issue. Let me admit that your ancestor were very shrewd people, they tried out every possible option to make you victim of their conformity, hammered down all the efforts of reason and disbeliefs. If in your previous birth you were offenders, what kind of punishment God inflicted on us. The punishment must me reformative so one can return back to the society as most of the competent and peace-loving citizen. Pain and suffering for the misdoings can be Jungle law, it can’t be the Law of God. Don’t quote you Purans, I have no scope of touching your methodologies. The greatest sin in this world is being poor. It’s a punishment. It is the root of all sin and misdoings. I ask you how far would you appreciate a jurist, a criminologist or a legislature who propose such measure of punishment which shall inevitably force men to commit more offences? Had not your God thought about it. Why doesn’t He remove all the poverty and famine from this world? Why don’t He change the mind of Warlords? Why does not your omnipresent and omnipotent God stop every human beings from committing any sin or offence? Not to mention the caste atrocities, just somebody is born in a certain strata of society how much disrespect one is put under again and again. He is hated and shunned by his fellow human beings who think themselves to be superior having been born in, say, a higher caste. His ignorance, his poverty, his broken self-esteem and the treatment meted out to him shall hardened his heart toward the society. Suppose he commits the sin. Who is responsible, the God who made him born in such a caste, he or the learned one of the society. These theories are the inventions of the privileged ones to justify their usurp powers, riches and superiority by the help of these theories.</p>

<p>Let your almighty bring the order in this world, if he does so I’ll believe in his existence. I don’t feel him in any way. The philosophy of His existence is just like the philosophy of existence of ghosts and evils though much advanced. There is no logic, all philosophies. As Schrodinger have shown that you can not be certain about the present state then simply you can not determine the future in any way. There is no fate, no luck, all is governed by the rules of nature. Rule hidden to be explored, crying so somebody can pay heed to them. Wasting time on philosophy makes no sense to me these days. Philosophy is good when you don’t have a direct logic but beware not to pick up something very wrong, just like we have chosen to believe in God and religion without any logic. I appreciate the intention behind these philosophies but intentions were taken aback. Your God, Is he enjoying all the woes of human race? A Changez, A Nero, Down with Him.</p>

<p>I am trying hard to overcome this word "GOD" illusion. Sporadically, i hurt myself whenever i utter this word " Oh! God" . it shows the weakness of me, that my instints has overthrown my reasons, my belief. But i am trying my best and one day i might say, "Yes, I am a perfect agnostic." Wish me all the very best. I respect what you believe, please do the same with me. If you want to prove I am wrong. Please advance your logical argument. I'll be highly grateful to you. :-)</p>

<p>Thanks...</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>Well that could be the article of the century. Lets start from art, i believe that art is somewhat cojugate to nature. What we are lacking in nature, human mind somehow intrigued by it and abstractly created this divine discipline. See the mordern building, artifects around you, all essentially have corners or sharp geometry which nature lacks, natural music is essentially chaotic and random ( most of the poet call it music like bird's cipper, waterfall sound etc), while human music is governed by some rules ( some would like to argure about hip-hop and rap music, that also have certain rhythm.). With the advances in chaos theory, this theory may collapse one day. Well, till then who cares. Now mathematics which is generally belived as a language to describe nature. As i earlier said nature is complement and/or conjugate to art, girls generally dont like mathematics ( as a language of nature, conjugate of art ) because they like art first. I think i solved a mystry and deserve a nobel prize ( or atleast ignobel. :-) )<br/>
There could be one more argument, i believe women are more developed than men as far as human development is considered. They imbibe the more human natures, well that i need not to explain, if you are girl u know it and often proudly flaunt it, and if you are a boy than also u know it at least from your mom. These all human feelings requires your heart to dominate over your mind ( don't get into the biology of these parts ), thats why girls weep a lot more than boys do after a breakup, i have seen boys weeping or sobbing too but they dont show it, it is not considered manly. Girls can do it, may flaunt it too. Mathematics such a logical subject where there sould not be a place for emotions will hardly get any girl interested by herself. Well, there is no question of someone ability to do well in math, its just a matter of liking. If girls can do wonder with art which in itself is the most abstract subject, why cant it be in abstract algebra.<br/>
Some eminent scholars have argued that all the subjects are essentially a part of the divine subject ( i too somehow believe it), taken this into account, All is bullshit! the bug stops here!</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>I am facing a real dilemma, how you feel when you are surrounded by really SERIOUS people who not just look serious, talk serious, may be think serious and perhaps eat serious. Most importantly, they give me a serious look, worse than my mother used to give me whenever I forgot my schoolbag in primary school in early childhood. It really patrified me. Not even students, prof here also the same with  some exception of course. Well i am not going to talk about them, i am still here and don't want to be thrown out of the IIT right away.<br/>
Now i am really serious about this seriousness, i want to think about it. What really seriousness is? Why think when you have wikipedia around. i checked it, it is also not that much serious, nothing is there. Then dictionary.com, " <em>requiring effort or concentration; complex and not easy to answer or solve</em>". oops, if it is seriousness, then in MPD class i am damn serious, but most of the people say they get serious to solve some problem, not to just get confused, so i am not serious in MPD class. honestly, i feel only one thing about being serious, when people are around and you are serious, then you want to show your importance or difference, if you are alone and you are serious, then your life is miserable or perhaps out of track. When you are serious while you are studying or working, then you want to fool yourself that you can do better than you can really do. In any case I dont find it honest to be serious in any part of life.<br/>
Confusing thing about it that everyone has a diffirent definition of seriousness.  So i think its futile to carry on this thing which is subjective.</p>

		<div class="entry"><p>I just love the concept of feedback, negative in particular. It makes lifestable and every system whatsoever. Its just not about system engineering or anyother discipline, it is pervasive in every aspect of your life and mine too, ofcourse. Consider a simple example, quite interesting and relevant, a girl and aboy fall in love with each other, they started giving compliments to each other,giving each other best of their criticism.  Thats nothing but a positivefeedback. I can not draw a figure here, otherwise it could be more lucid. Now,one starts loving other more, that in itself is positive feedback, its increasethe love of the other person for the first one. Here we got a loop, just like incase of astable multi-vibrator. This 'love-system' now reaches its maximum valueafter a time when the response of each person saturates. This is due to themental and physical capabilities of the each individuals. You don't have to beKurt Godel to figure out that when a system is running at its full capacity, itbound to be collapsed. The time it takes to collapse depends on the variousaspects of the individuals, these aspects, lets call them components of thesystem. Maturity, level of compromising nature, level of ego, etc could betermed as the characteristics of these components which sets the time limit ofthis collapse. But for sure, it will collapse. That what happen in the lovemarriages where there a loop is established of positive nature. For sustaining arelationship, there is a vital need of negative feedback, though it induce manyparameters which in turn degrade short term performance. Initially it mayfacilitate large settling time ( which in our system of interest is strength ofrelationship) if feedback coefficient is high. So make sure, negative feedbackcoefficient should be small enough, otherwise your system is not going to givethe desired output, and hence no question of stability. Well i have to perfectthis theory, right now i am feeling hungry, gotta go for dinner.<br/>
This theory can be applied to homosexual too. I am not sex biased!<br/>
Don't forget to give your "negative feedback" about this blog.</p>
