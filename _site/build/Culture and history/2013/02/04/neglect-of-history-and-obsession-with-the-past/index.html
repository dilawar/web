        <div class="entry"><p>One of our historians noted the lack of taste for accurate historical writing
rather ruefully. 'India, for its great literary heritage', noted D. D.  Kosambi,
'has produced no historical writers comparable to Herodotus,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides">Thucydides</a>, Polybius, Livy, Tacitus'.
This is despite of the fact that many Indian kings of the middle ages were  not
only 'incomparably superior in their education and literally ability to
contemporary rulers in Europe', they also 'personally led great armies to
victory in heavy warfare'. None of them considered it worthwhile to write
anything comparable to Caesar's Commentaries or Xenophon's Anabasis. 'The
tradition was of graceful court drama, an occasional hymn in praise of the gods,
or a witty epigram'.  Kosambi commented further that only Rajatarangani by a
Kasmirian named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalhana">Kalhana</a>  (A.D.  1149-50)
and continued by two successors can be called anything like a historical
document. Unfortunately, 'this chronicles suffer from all the mannered
conventions of Sanskrit poetry, in particular the fatal double entendre that
manages only to obscure whatever reality the author meant to portray'. Even when
the period Kalhana was describing was 'a period was of desperate struggle
between the central power and feudal lords in Kashmir', he cared not to note the
'actual time and place' which can 'hardly be compared in quality, depth, content
to the account by Thucydides of the Peloponnesian war'. For the rest of the
country, till the Muslim period, we have nothing even as good as Kalhana. Some
older written records which survived such as Puranas ( = the ancient stories),
'are only religious fables and cant with whatever historical content the works
once possessed heavily encrusted by myth, diluted with semi-religious legends,
effaced during successive redactions copied by innumerable, careless scribes'.
Forget constructing the past from it, one can not even make 'as must as
king-lists' [1].</p>

<p>Judging the quality of contemporary historical writing in learned journals and
books is beyond me. However, it is easy to notice apathy towards history around
us. Many of Indian states are bigger than most of the European countries but a
few books are being written about what can be called their history. National
scene is only somewhat better. There is no television channel dedicated to
history worth the name. Our sense of personal history is no better. I wonder if
many Indians who can tell their family lineage which goes back more than 2-3
generations (I plead guilty).  The prominence of oral culture at the cost of
written culture for knowledge-exchange has no doubt played its part but the real
reason lies somewhere else. We do not prefer to talk about history either.
There is perhaps something in our culture which makes us indifferent to our
history. When a British born Indian historian wondered about this usual Indian
apathy towards it historical monuments, he was told by his Hindu friend, "You
must understand that we are Hindus and we burn our dead."</p>

<p>Yet, there is an increasing obsession with past which has little
to do with knowing the past accurately. It is largely animated by a desire to
glorify it. Tradition of dispassionate pursuit of history never had a strong
presence in India and our current value-system does not encourage it either. It
is a widely shared belief among students and their parents that history (any
form of humanities indeed) is a subject which only last on the merit-list would
take-up in school and a real loser will pick it up for a profession.</p>

<p>One needs not be a psychologist to notice the growing feelings of misery among
Indian about their nationality. This feeling is sustained by lack of coherence
and dignity in the present. Much of it also goes back to our close encounter
with western powers during colonization which humbled our traditional pride and
took away a part of our dignity. If one looks at the writings of Indian
intellectuals during this time, they were doing two things simultaneously :
telling people abroad how great things Indian are (its spirituality, its way of
life, the whole civilization indeed) and used superlatives to describe them.
Back at home they were castigating fellow-citizen for this-and-that and asking
them to change their medieval mindsets and customs. Indeed, most of the
reformers who went abroad to deliver lectures were of this kind. They painted
India as 'greatest civilization' abroad and they felt ashamed of the same
civilization's current state at home and prodded their countrymen with great
emotional appeal to change [2]. Their heirs have now started talking about India
and Bharat. They themselves belong to India which contains everything that is
good and rest of us belong to the Bharat, an unchanging and backward country for
which they only have scorn and pity. Educated people are self-consciously
virtuous everywhere, in India they are excessively so.</p>

<p>Indians are deeply conscious of being Indian. They really feel proud when a
match is won by their team, a rocket is successful launched by ISRO, a missile
is tested by DRDO, one of their movies is given or nominated for a Oscar, an
Indian buys a company abroad, a person with Indian name goes to space, and an
Indian is recognized by western world. And they flaunt this pride aggressively.
Western awards have come to mean a great deal to them. Their newspaper's global
news is all about Indians doing well abroad. The xenotrophism  -- the attraction
to the foreign, this loving (and hating) preoccupation with what Kingsley Amim
called "abroad" -- is to be accounted for largely by the sense of superiority of
foreign things and the inferiority of Indian things. The obsession has reached
to a level that one of our more exuberant psychologists has noted that if good
Indian and good Chinese has lived a virtuous life, they  have started going not
to heaven but to New York. Abroad has become a status-symbol and it is chased
with a great zeal. It perhaps makes them lower on their self-esteem but it helps
them stand tall is a deeply status-conscious society.</p>

<p>Those who are left behind despite trying really hard develops a growing sense of
social-worthlessness and also suffer from an acute sense of inferiority. But
they are not the only one. The difference between who has left, who is about to
leave and those who could not leave can do real harm to their self-esteem.
Present and Future of India do not offer them any possibility to overcome these
feelings either.  The media and newspapers are competing with each other to
spread the feelings of misery about present and future. Their newspapers are
filled with stories telling them how pathetic is the situation is in their
country; and it has become a fashion among intelligentsia to find a crisis
everywhere. It is not entirely their fault if they feel sad, ashamed and
miserable about their homeland.  Nonetheless, they are mortified by all of this.
They see it more of an outcome of some moral deficiency rather than an outcome
of their own actions which can be changed.  This can only lead to fatalism and
the enhanced feelings of misery about being Indian itself.</p>

<p>History, especially when it is poorly documented, can be invoked with great
effect to lessen these feeling of misery. And an increasing number of Indians
are willing and even eager to be convinced of the myths of national greatness
and glory. It is a seductive myth and like all myths, when evidence in support
are lacking, they are created and easily accepted. History demands that when
evidence are lacking,  the argument must rest without a conclusion but those who
are already determined to conclude something about their past, myth and not
history offers them vast opportunities.</p>

<p>Indian civilization has many achievements to its credit and there is nothing
wrong for feeling proud about it. But when a past is invoked in India, as in
many other countries which locates their utopia in the past, it is usually to
glorify its achievements and not to speak of its failings. It is unbelievable
that any nation can have only achievements and no failing. What do they try to
achieve by brushing a nation's failings under the carpet rather than elevating
the moods? Nonetheless, those who are told of the grandeur of past also see the
misfortune of present. And it is <a href="http://www.telegraphindia.com/1031011/asp/opinion/story_2433186.asp">explained due
to</a> 'the
intervention of colonial rule' and the plunders by ruthless attackers before
them.</p>

<blockquote><p>The same text-books that represent the India of the past as a land overflowing
with milk and honey also represent colonial rule as a period of relentless
plunder, spoliation and degradation.... The British were no doubt alien
intruders who disrupted a contented and harmonious way of life. But were they
the first or only intruders to do so' What our radical and liberal historians
have started is being continued further back into the past by other
historians. A recent account of the pristine greatness of India and its
spoliation by the British ends by saying that perhaps the gloom had set in
earlier, around AD 1000. Who were the bearers of this pre-British gloom' Could
they have been Afghans, or Turks' The myth of the destruction of everything
that was good in India by the British has extensions that may not all be
pleasing to those who have contributed to its making.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are many among us who are too willing to construct  a past where there is
only grandeur and glory and no failing. Almost all of us are too willing to
accept this version of past as the only version. It may have been a great tool
in elevating the mood of many Indians but this mood-lifting by construction of
myths is not going to do much good to them. The reasons behind this hatred may
not be easy to find or remove but these seductive myths are not going to help
remove them either [2]. However, this obsession with glorious past can easily
divert attention from the dispassionate pursuit of history. History is best
pursued by those dispassionate individuals who are driven by the curiosity to
know what they really were and not by those who are easily intoxicated by
seductive myths.</p>
