        <div class="entry"><p>How little space is given to poverty, labour and agriculture reporting  in Indian media is no secret. This week EPW edition has published a  study high-lightening percentage of new-items in Hindi-English media  about rural area. This study says that '.. India’s highest circulated  English and Hindi dailies finds that they devote only a minuscule  proportion of their total coverage (about 2%) to rural India’s issues,  crises and anxieties. <strong>Even this low count could be misleading because  most rural news is not about the farmers/villagers or about their  concerns related to land, livestock, resources or farming. </strong>The  content analysis of 968 news items shows that 36% of the coverage goes  to issues of violence, accidents, crime or disasters. Less than 28% is  about agrarian themes while 15% is about hunger, suicides, malnutrition,  distress migration, displacement, or farmers’ movements. The English  newspapers had more coverage of rural distress than the Hindi ones. The  a­uthoritative sources quoted most often in the routine news tend to  belong to the establishment.'</p>

<p>ABOUT EDITORIAL SPACE... On an average, the country’s top  circulation papers devoted about 2% editorial space of their  national/flagship editions with predominantly urban readerships to the  issues and concerns of two-thirds of India.</p>

<p>No newspaper (including Hindu) devotes more than 3.6% of their space to rural story.</p>

<p>THE  QUANTITY OF REPORT... A routine rural story is a brief, single or  double column item on the inside pages and is straight and matter of  fact. Explanations or backgrounders or the likely causes of an incident  are rare. A considerably large number of stories are displayed in the  “briefs” sections which carry just a paragraph or two in a column so  tagged.</p>

<p>SOURCE OF THE REPORT... Most of the prominent and authoritative sources quoted <strong>are often described by media scholars as the “primary definers” of the i­ssues involved</strong>. <strong>These  sources normally have a stake in the issues they try to promote or  block. Much of the routine news coverage is a result of a regular  interaction between media organisation and authoritative source  organisations.</strong> Normally reporters on the beat generate news through  regular and institutionalised i­nteraction with government authorities.  These sources tend to be mainstream politicians and bureaucrats, and  sometimes the civil society activists and other alternative sources.  (Emphasis mine)</p>

<p>AND THE WORST PART... Tables 8 and 9 show that <strong>bureaucrats are not among the preferred sources when it comes to stories about extreme rural poverty or agrarian distress</strong>. However, the government establishment, particularly <strong>politicians are frequently quoted as sources of news in this category</strong>.  A very high proportion of extreme rural poverty theme stories originate  from the reports of academic and other institutions such as the  non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and development agencies. <strong>It is  equally noteworthy that the issues of agrarian distress are the only  area where the peoples’ movements are among the most quoted sources of  news.</strong></p>

<p>AND THE DRUG-PEDDLERS ARGUMENT [3], "<strong>One reason for their lack of  interest could be explained by the fact that their readers, advertisers  and journalists, particularly in the metropolitan editions, come from  urban backgrounds. The dailies tend to be more consumer focused and try  to fulfil the needs and aspirations of educated and upwardly mobile  urban consumers whose universe often has limited space for issues of  poverty and underdevelopment." </strong>[4]<strong> </strong>Now the question arises about the rural-policies formulated by Santa Banta of planning commission sicne <strong>'glaring  omission of rural news in metro editions assumes significance because  of their disproportionate readership among the policy elites and opinion  leaders.' </strong>[2]</p>

<p>On personal level, I have always found it amusing that the Indian  intelligentsia (whether right, left, centre, any -ist, -vian) has  somewhat mixed attitude towards the rural areas. While educated Indians  are inclined to think or at least speak well for the village, they do  not show much inclination for the company of villagers, or for that  matter, anyone who is less-fortunate than them. This is not unusual or  novel in the city-bred individuals. In fact, some of the very best of  them, Rabindra Nath Tagore, M K Gandhi and Nehru had quite romantic  views about villages. These views were mercilessly castigated by  Ambedkar who unlikely others had the first hand experience of Indian  village life [5]. In a set of lectures delivered at Aligarh some 35  years ago, the historian Niharranjan Ray drew attention to urban Indian  perennial nostalgic romance towards Indian villages. This nostalgia, he  observed, "had been expressed since the 19th century in the literary  form in fiction and poety and in political form in the slogan 'back to  the villages'." He further said, "the curious aspect of the whole thing  is that with but few exceptions these writers and poets and these  nationalist leaders were all city dwellers, not villagers themselves,  not were they ever thinking of trekking back to the villages to live  there."

Srinivas, have high-lightened  same habit of his fellow economists at DSE: 'policies formulated by  those who do not know the difference between sowing and reaping'. He had  a line that field view and book view are two different things. For  instance see his classical contibution, "Social change in modern India" -  Orient BlackSwan</p>

<p>[3] According to P. Sainath, "If the patriotism is the last refuse  of an scoundrel and 'what my reader wants' is the last refuse of an  morally and intellectually corrupt editor. This is what a drug peddler  would say, "Hey I am decent guy. These assholes on the street want it  what do I do?" See [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QewCqpgBiuw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QewCqpgBiuw</a>]</p>

<p>[4] The glaring absence of intellect from the mass media is perhaps  too apparent to be discussed. After all, the largest selling Indian  English daily boasts itself for not having a single book review page.</p>
