        <div class="entry"><p>There was a time when she was a mother who cared about all of her children. Even in the early day's of her Independence, when she had little to feed all of her children. she managed really well. <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=9078987899127917834#">These days, she only cares about her children who look beautiful. She has long tuned her back on the children who look ugly</a> (as a rule of thumb, villagers and migrant workers). Tribals had never been her favorites. Even in the time of great king <em>Ashoka</em> they were known as '<em>trouble maker</em>'.</p>

<p>By the way, most of us farmers and laborer are oblivion to this facts that she no longer feel our pain. Bloody stupid people, still have the same romantic views of India as Nehru had about her. There are people who call spade a spade but who have access to their writings. First of all, they do write in English (I plead guilty) and regional media does not like them anyway since they can not have an advertisement if they are going to give them space. It is perhaps an irony of ours that even though we are the only one who vote government in and out, still they do not seem to care about us. All these urbane middle class get their ways even though they never vote. Anyway..</p>

<p>We celebrated her Independence in the best way we could. For my father, this day did not matter much for he shaped his world-views (or regional-views) what he saw and felt by himself. He, like most of the not-so-educated farmers do not wonder about this world. They simply know how this world work. This quality is missing in our educated or 'curious' friends. They do wonder a lot and get confused. My mother, though less educated than my father, deliberately refuse to live in reality. She trust radio more than what she sees. What she heard on radio is like old time '<em>akashvani</em>' which has to be true. If they say that there are golden days ahead for India, so it must be true. <em>Prasar Bharti</em> is anyway more sensible then all of other channels put together. She always enjoy the I-day, probably today also she must have felt happiness larger than other days. For her, it is a special day. Today, first on Doordarshan, she would watch that impressive parade and then cook something special perhaps '<em>suji ka halwa'. </em>Then she'd call be and ask me to wake up and take a bath as early as possible but today my incoming are barred. That must have reduced her happiness.</p>

<p>In those childhood days, there were our teachers. They liked this day too. Everyone of them used to come on time on this days in the best possible clothes. Then we'd march in village chanting slogans of freedom fighters and watch the movie on DD in afternoon.</p>

<p>In my childhood, like every other children, I was not critical. In our school library, we did not have Arundhati Roy or George Orwell (Yes, the Hindi translation. I think there wasn't any). We had all the stuff which make you fall in love with India. We had <em>Chacha Nehru</em>. We had Vivekananda. We even had Gandhi. But we did not have all the people who lived in villages and have not-so-romantic views about India. We did not have anything written by Ambedkar or Patel. I lived in my small village in my own daydreams shaped by all the popular people about all the popular things - no space for pessimism.</p>

<p>Then there were cities.</p>

<p>This was the time I start reading elite English newspapers on regular basis. In Chennai, now when I think about it - I was fortunate enough that they could maintain a newspaper like "<em>The Hindu</em>". In our north India, our largest read newspaper does not have a book- review page. Less I say is better about this <em>Times of Idiots. </em>I already had a lot of garbage in my head filled by corporate media. I did not realize that news now mean how many click you can get on it or how much advertisement you can put around it and editors and journalists have been replaced by managers and stenographers. I appreciated this '<em>bazaru</em>' views after all I was dreaming to earn my future bread and butter from this '<em>bazar</em>' only in which I did succeed. I plead guilty.</p>

<p>During my U.G. in Chennai, in the "<em>Communication Skills</em>" exam, teacher asked me to interpret an article. There is something I could still remember. Someone was saying about their Russian newspaper.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Oh! Our Newspapers, There is truth on sport page, half truth on business page and lies everywhere." ..... "Editorials! Ah, what you mean is the page by which we separate our advertisements."</p></blockquote>

<p>And now Mark Twain was making sense to me...</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Yours was not, in the beginning, a criminal nature, but     circumstances changed it. At the age of nine, you stole sugar. At the age of     fifteen, you stole money. At twenty, you stole horses. At twenty-five, you     committed arson. At thirty, hardened in crime, you became an editor.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>My own experiences with readings showed me how much I believed in newspapers even though my own experience was not agreeing with them at all. I simply refused my experiences. I hated not-educated people. I hated those villagers in the belief that they are the bottleneck in our growth and without them we could have long become "<em>Tiger Economy</em>" (I dont know why the name it like this when the real 'Tiger' is getting extinct). Yes, give their land to Reliance of Tata and let us have the riches person on the earth then we'll feel like the leader in the world. These ugly looking people does not know the difference between 'hard' and 'smart' and do not appreciate the concept of 'profit' -<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/oct/08/economics-nobel-women-bailout-stockmarket"> I could have cited some Nobel Laureate of Economics.</a> Why they work so hard for so less? Rational game theory! Even though I knew the answers. I lived there for 16 years and have the first hand experience how things work in rural India. Perhaps the urge to become the English speaking elite (with at least two accent, one is for home and one is for outside) was too strong to get blinded. Media tell us what we like to read or listen, they are much different from politicians. They is also a necessity for them. You know, if you tell people something they already know they thank you for it. <a href="http://www.monbiot.com/">Tell them something they do not know, they will hate you for it.</a> They can not make huge profit if they start pissing off their readers. Someone else will take their place. See out largest selling English newspaper (<em>Times of India), </em>sexuality oozes out of it very first page.</p>

<p>I did not like people opposing so-called development. I liked the idea that someone has to suffer for development but I never asked myself why always only poor have to suffer. There was massive cuts in rural health and food security programs (they call it subsidy) but they give over 60 lacs a minute for corporates (and call it incentives). <a href="http://beta.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/article123884.ece?homepage=true">And still they call every budget farmer friendly</a>.</p>

<p>All the success stories about India is true but the other story which<a href="http://www.indiatogether.org/opinions/psainath/"> P. Sainath</a> pains to tell is also very true. But we are living in a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2F94.126.106.9%2FDocuments%2Fpublications1%2Fpublic-attitudes-april10.pdf&amp;ei=X_dnTPWdNcL38AaHlcC3BA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEXayepveN4NVaJZVCf8zAJFmNURQ&amp;sig2=WT2iww_gL6Ep2awHNk219g">time of history in which concern for poor is slowly declining</a> and India, having empathy for ugly looking people may be the lowest in the world (Remember here everyone loves to own a costliest fairness cream. Yes, even the men. Ask Saharukh Khan if you find hard to believe it). <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2010/04/26/why-dont-indians-give-more/">With an exception of old Tata, we never had generous rich. Our beloved billionaires (unless they are old Banglorian) do not build university or hospitals for people who are in need</a>. They may like to build helli-pads and all. And you know, in India, whenever a rich person wants to do anything they need government support and they hate to admit in public that they are living on charity. If someone from them like Narayan Murthy felt the pain and hit back at their counterparts, he suddenly found himself ostracized by corporate media - Now, Nanden Nilekani is their faviorite. Once their beloved P.M. Manmohan also asked these rich people to cut down their salaries. Holy crap! Suddenly whole of the media went against him. <em>Pay peanuts and get monkey</em>, they were chanting. No! <em>Pay gold and get Gorillas</em>. Someone could have asked before.</p>

<p>I still find it unbelievable how many Indians choose to ignore the massive poverty in India. How many of them find it very hard to digest that 770 million (75%) of Indians lives below Rs. 20 day. Some even say that some pissed of leftist came up with these terms even <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSDEL218894">if the figures are put up on government websites</a> by government. It is well known in academic circles but if a person who can read a bit should know that much about a land which he/she calls his/her mother. Perhaps the empathy and sympathy is not a typical element of Indians. Even the better half of them, Indian female, have not produced a single Mother Theresa. We have produced <em>Baba Amte</em> (We still have not given him <em>Bharat Ratna</em>. By the way, We respect rich and powerful and the missile makers). Among the female politicians, only one who seems to concerned about poor or female is Italian born <em>Sonia Gandhi</em>.</p>

<p>It is really easy to become cynic in India and Indians can be very exasperating at times. Whatever you can say about India, its opposite is also equally true. I have liking for dissidents for anything significant ever come to this world came from dissidents. This is the first requirement to do something new, you must find old picture imperfect. If you want to feel disconnected there are a lot of philosophy. These poverty problem can be seen in many ways. Like, "Over a billion people, of course they are poor. No one have unlimited resources." You can still go to the higher label, "I worry about bigger things like universe. Humans are not worth worrying about." But one thing is for sure, no matter what you do or what you think, One should keep in mind, less one consume is better of others. You need not care about others if you do not mind when they stop caring about you. Like Naxals!</p>

<p>I can not say that India fails her children on all accounts - on most of the accounts she does. I was able to make to the its one of the most elite Institute even though I was not suppose to. But these are few incidents. You can not capture the reality - but you can pollute the reality by citing them.The best thing about I like about India that She gives hope to all of her children. Even <em>Arundhati Roy</em> have not lost her mind - she still seems to be hopeful. About Indians, I like their disaster management capabilities. As a race, I do not have very high opinion about Indians. They do not have those "conqueror" attitude. At best they choose the best possible option available. Perhaps that is why We were able to survive. Greeks did not. Spartan failed. You know, its the tigers and lions which get extinct. Dogs and pests never get extinct. At large, Indian change their views as the time wants them to be. Remember your childhood when you did not like the idea leaving you motherland if given a chance. Now?</p>

<p>I have not doubt about her survival, but would she be able to live? I am always doubtful, yet hopeful!</p>
