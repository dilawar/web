        <div class="entry"><p>India is a funny land, I always like to argue. In fact so funny that sometimes it seems to be exasperating. When it comes to irony, nothing matches India. This is a land where temporary arrangements are most permanent (reservation, schedule 9 etc). This is also a land which have a rising economy 8-10% though creating jobs at 1%. It has second most number of billionaire still 80% of her population lives below Rs 20 a day. The most global city of her is in news in for localisms and blah blah...</p>

<p>But that is not what I meant to write today. I keep an eye on gender issues, mostly in India. The position of women is India is also ironical. Sometimes they are worshiped as goddess, and most of time otherwise. The <a href="http://www.thp.org/where_we_work/south_asia/india/research_reports/chronic_hunger_and_status_of_women">current gender inequality and hunger in India</a> is a matter of concern for every public spirited Indian.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.littlemag.com/pdf/contents-venusenvy.pdf">Lets get to the point</a>. In hindu religion, there are lot of goddess (devi). Prominent are three. But they are not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Goddess">central deity</a>. In spite of their power, knowledge and wealth, they had been married (or denied individuality in letter and spirit) to the three gods, the trinity. <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/god-woman-merlin-stone/015696158x-apw3fnvhfe">Not in Vedas, but later after Vedanta</a>.  Perhaps, that did not serve the purpose of<em> <a href="http://hinduism.about.com/library/weekly/aa051303a.htm">Manuvadi</a></em>. A fearsome, uncontrolled <em>devi</em> were to be a <em>biwi, </em>an uncontrolled power had to be subjugated. They made a morality out of it.<a href="http://www.svabhinava.org/Dialogues/SarasvatiUnicorn/index.php"> Indus civilization has some sort of central deity</a>. Since Indus script is still un-deciphered its hard to say exactly how these deity were treated, whether they were total independent or considered as 'the other half'.</p>

<h2>Perhaps world could have been better off in gender-equality if the deity were left only <em>devi </em>and the the status of <em>Biwi</em> could be an additional one . One should be attached with the least number to identities. It makes life harder to create an identity for oneself otherwise.  </h2>
