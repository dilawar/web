        <div class="entry"><p>Well that could be the article of the century. Lets start from art, i believe that art is somewhat cojugate to nature. What we are lacking in nature, human mind somehow intrigued by it and abstractly created this divine discipline. See the mordern building, artifects around you, all essentially have corners or sharp geometry which nature lacks, natural music is essentially chaotic and random ( most of the poet call it music like bird's cipper, waterfall sound etc), while human music is governed by some rules ( some would like to argure about hip-hop and rap music, that also have certain rhythm.). With the advances in chaos theory, this theory may collapse one day. Well, till then who cares. Now mathematics which is generally belived as a language to describe nature. As i earlier said nature is complement and/or conjugate to art, girls generally dont like mathematics ( as a language of nature, conjugate of art ) because they like art first. I think i solved a mystry and deserve a nobel prize ( or atleast ignobel. :-) )<br/>
There could be one more argument, i believe women are more developed than men as far as human development is considered. They imbibe the more human natures, well that i need not to explain, if you are girl u know it and often proudly flaunt it, and if you are a boy than also u know it at least from your mom. These all human feelings requires your heart to dominate over your mind ( don't get into the biology of these parts ), thats why girls weep a lot more than boys do after a breakup, i have seen boys weeping or sobbing too but they dont show it, it is not considered manly. Girls can do it, may flaunt it too. Mathematics such a logical subject where there sould not be a place for emotions will hardly get any girl interested by herself. Well, there is no question of someone ability to do well in math, its just a matter of liking. If girls can do wonder with art which in itself is the most abstract subject, why cant it be in abstract algebra.<br/>
Some eminent scholars have argued that all the subjects are essentially a part of the divine subject ( i too somehow believe it), taken this into account, All is bullshit! the bug stops here!</p>
