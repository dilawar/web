<p><strong>"IF this silly fellow keeps writing the things he does and saying the things he says, then he has no future at all. Certainly no one in power or positions of authority can ever forgive him,”</strong></p>

<p><strong>-- <a href="http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2418/stories/20070921507010900.htm">Khwaja Ahmad Abbas</a>,
</strong></p>

<p><strong>What I try to do is look at the survival strategies of the poor, which is a much more interesting journalism. I try to focus not on the ‘events’ but on the ‘processes’ of poverty. In India we have what some writers have called a situation of ‘invisible hunger’. We do not have acute situations of famine (like in Somalia or the Sudan) but a more generalized distress. In the face of extreme exploitation, you see little kids who do not ‘look’ starving but they are very malnourished. In my reporting, I am engaged in a battle for minds and hearts. Why should I concede the readers of the press to the big press barons? I want to bring the Indian press back to its original mission. </strong></p></blockquote>

<p> -- P. Sainath, in 1994</p>

<p>During my under-graduation in 2005, I read his article first time in Hindu newspaper. It was pleasingly surprising to notice someone in media knows villages and its life so well. Never before I had come across anything so authentically written on our lives in any newspaper. Journalists do write about villages and villagers but their writing is animated by wishful thinking. They rarely write about villagers as they see them. Even if they go to a village, they talk to some  'activist'  and next day his life is advertised as 'the ideal middle-class life' to their consumers. They are interested in eyeball-catching virtuous lifestyles and not in opinions of farmers and villagers on what is ailing them. He is altogether a very different breed of  journalist : he spends over 260 days a year in villages.</p>

<p>While most of the journalists were busy lobbying for their consumers and advertisers, he showed no interest in becoming a 'stenographer to the powerful'. He was interested in bottom 10% of the society in an industry which cares about only top 10%. Since he compare and contrast the bottom 10% with the top 10%, it makes the top 10% uncomfortable. He holds the mirror in front of 'Beautiful People' and shows them their ugly spot.</p>

<p>Graduated in history, he became an authority on rural economy and agriculture, and by extension, as Prof. Amartya Sen labeled him, one of the <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=9078987899127917834">world's greatest experts on famine and hunger.</a> He came under severe attack for not showing faith in the <a href="http://www.india-seminar.com/2001/497/497%20p.%20sainath.htm">religion of market</a>. Nonetheless, He got many admirers. A supreme court judge wrote that his "<em>name should be written in letters of gold in the history of India journalism</em>". It must be! <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459573/">Documentaries were made</a> on his journalism and his journalism is being <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Intp4IUphPo">discussed in classrooms</a>. Collection of his articles and news reports  are used as handbook by NGOs. In Scandinavia, the United Kingdom and Canada people found relevance in it for their own countries. In the United Kingdom it is being used by journalists to cover local issues of poverty and by more than 30 universities around the world, in the UK, Canada, and Australia. He has done a great service to his profession. Google scholar reports that his work is often cited in sociology and economics journals.</p>

<p>What are journalists for? Like intellectuals, they are the keeper of nation's conscience. Their primary job is to report. He belongs to a tribe where a journalist stands for some value. All radical journalists have stood for some value. And those who stand for some value not only report, they often provoke. They have the belief the it is OK to stretch the point somewhat if it serves a greater cause. Their work may not be immensely valuable for a sociologist but they preserve the truth for posterity. A journalist work is immensely valuable if a future historian can reconstruct the past from it. How many journalists today will pass the test of 'future historian'?</p>

<p>I am not sure how many professionals today like to be known by their work rather than the name of organization they work for. In those pre-color days, many believe that it was journalists who build a niche of their newspaper by their work; they wrote for public and in turn, they were hugely admired by public. They were inspiration to future journalists. Guardian's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/jan/25/cudlipp-lecture-alan-rusbridger">editor-in-chief</a> remembers why he loved some journalists because to him <em>"they seemed to represent the best of journalistic virtues – courage, campaigning, toughness, compassion, humour, irreverence; a serious engagement with serious things; a sense of fairness; an eye for injustice; a passion for explaining; knowing how to achieve impact; a connection with readers ... but, more importantly, about why [journalism] mattered".</em> If you are looking for any journalist who posses these qualities, ask for that <a href="http://www.indiatogether.org/opinions/psainath/">incorruptible and feisty rural reporter</a> named P. Sainath.</p>

<p>The sort of journalism which Sainath champions is on decline. For newspapers are increasingly getting more interested in eyeballs than what is connected with the eyeballs. They claim that they are forced to do it because this is what their readers want. This is odd for they rarely ask their readers what they want to read. Besides one of their heroes, Steve Jobs has proved that, 'consumers do not know what they want unless you show it to them'. Even if we believe for the sake of their argument that their readers are really interested in that sort of crap; this can not be expected from newspapers. For 'this is a kind of argument a drug paddler would make,'  says Sainath, 'Look! I am decent guy, these ass-holes on the street want this stuff. What can I do?'. Perhaps this is exactly the sort of thing which has happened. There is a little difference left between the business model of a drug paddler and a media house. The only difference between an newspaper and a drug paddler is that while the business model of a drug paddler is 'illegal' and low on public sympathy, newspapers can get away with the noise of 'self-regulation'. Media houses will do well to remember that this right of free speech -- indeed any right -- is not absolute. A society can not survive, let alone flourish, where its members care only for their rights and show no inclination for discharging their duties. Besides public sympathy is not an inexhaustible commodities. Ask Manmohan Singh. Someone will try to regularize it when they will find that public sympathy is no longer on the side of media. If there are some lessons to be learned from what is happening in U.K. after Leveson report, it is now!</p>
