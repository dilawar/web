        <div class="entry"><h1>WEEK 3 :</h1>

<p>Meeting time : Saturday, Feb 09, 2013</p>

<p>It was canceled because Prof. HN was not available.</p>

<h1>WEEK 2 :</h1>

<p>Meeting time : Saturday, Feb 02, 2013, 2.00pm onwards</p>

<p>This week only 15-20 students turned up compared to 44 last week. It was announced that <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~mitter/">Prof. Sanjoy K. Mittar</a> who is visiting the department would be interacting with students. It seems that presence of an eminent scholar did not increase their enthusiasm.<!-- more --></p>

<p>Prof Mittar is in his seventies and he talked slowly. He drew a sharp line between scholarship and original research. He pointed out that one can keep learning his whole life and build a scholarship but it does not necessarily lead to original research. I am not sure if he put a larger value on original research. Prof Narayanan quoted a line from a poem which he read in his school. This line is 'to see the world in grain of sand' which he interpreted, 'do a small problem and do it thoroughly and one would learn a great deal about other things'. Prof. Mittar also suggested that one should prefer to pursue one's Ph. D. in a field which is less crowded. Perhaps, so that there is more scope for creativity. He also made a distinction between science and engineering. While the former is about discovering the fundamental limits, the later is concerned about maximum limits.</p>

<p>Prof. Mittar has a line of research. He emphasized that IITs must engage themselves on the national problem as MIT has been doing.</p>

<p>I asked him whether he sees a difference between intellectual cultures of India and US or IIT Bombay and MIT. He made a point that IIT Bombay surely can not hope to replicate the resources MIT has but there are certain areas where IIT Bombay can work effectively. He was not sure whether it answered my question and I replied in negative. Of course, I had to explain my point of view and sociologists are notorious for not able to make their point in nutshell. I mentioned that my point of view is usually the point of view of sociology (HN chuckled) which studies how the cultures (or the habit of hearts) define the way an individual acts. We compare and contrast. Therefore I was curious if he noted something in our culture compared to US culture which can act against doing research. This discussion lead into another direction which I terminated. He asked whether I want to be a sociologist. I did not rule out the possibility. He mentioned light heartedly if I knew that sociology is in crisis. 'Well, they say there is a crisis everywhere these days', was my answer to it. He smiled and suggested as one can also define crisis. I found him to be a very generous, kind-hearted and down-to-earth man. It was nice to have him in our meet.</p>

<p>The reason behind reduction of number of students joining the meeting is not very clear to me this time. Whatever is the reason behind it, it has to be conceded that we do not put very high value on such meetings. Of course, they can be inspired and encouraged to join but it does not contradict the hypothesis that their natural inclination (or habit of hearts as I'd like to phrase such things) is not for such discussion. This is not to say that this can be changed.</p>

<p>Such discussion, where students exchange ideas with each others and suggest some probable solutions to one's problem, are great facilitator of research in any academic institute. And we have a poor record in such discussion in our department. We have enthusiasm for starting magazines and start-up. These magazines and start-up do not survive for long but they are a great thing to be put on one's resume. I have heard one undergraduate complaining that the reason behind such startup is to get admission to London School of Economics. I can't vouch how much truth is there in this assertion but it is not entirely false.</p>

<p>Magazines or newsletters can be a by-product of discussions, it can not replace discussions altogether. Most of the great research institutes are there where they are these days because they had this tradition of building groups where people put great values on such a culture. Students can not be faulted for this. This is prevalent among faculty in our universities (our department has good record when it comes to the tradition 'talking with each other'). They divide themselves into factions, euphemistically called 'like minded intellectuals'.  Now we have more number of students on the department but on feels that Prof. Betteille is right when he observed that while our universities 'proliferated and grew in size', but could no longer 'conform to the original concept of a self-governing community of scholars — they are neither self-governing nor do they have a sense of community or scholarship.'</p>

<p>What I wish to look forward to study in following meetings is that whether they are showing a growing sense of community of scholarship (or original research as its byproduct).</p>

<h1>WEEK 1 :</h1>

<p>Prof. Harihar Narayanan (HN) retired last month from Electrical Engineering Department. He has been be at the center of student mentor-ship program for undergraduates at institute level. I believe that he had some success with academically poor undergraduates. And since department has tried hard to retain him for few more years as adjunct-professor, he plans to devote one day each week to mentor department’s research scholars. Each Saturday we will meet to discuss this-and-that. This is a great opportunity for me as a sociologist to do some field work as participant-observer. And to get some taste of social life also.</p>

<p>In the last meeting, there were around 44 PhD students, mainly from EE and some from CSE department. Few of them were new students but mainly they were senior Ph. D. students.</p>

<p>He likes to talk and feels rejuvenated after giving a good lecture. It was not easy for him but he tried hard not to make this discussion monologue. He encouraged students to point out problems and to offer suggestions and comments for the department. Many of them are listed below. Not in the same form they were uttered by the students, he generalized many of them. It was a moderated session and a senior faculty was present. Therefore many of these comments and complains are very mild compared to what they usually complain to their peers. The Indian habit of ‘comparing everything with the worst’ is not visible. There is a good chance that something useful will come out of this.</p>

<p><strong>Complaints</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Research (in India?) driven by publication rather than originality.</p></li>
<li><p>Not always `relevant’.</p></li>
<li><p>PhD students dont work hard. (No one complained about it, this one he put on board by himself).</p></li>
<li><p>Little or no office space.</p></li>
<li><p>TA duties not always spelled out clearly and workload is not shared properly.</p></li>
<li><p>How to make learning/exploration enjoyable.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes a student is interested in a topic other than the allotted one. (On this he talks for a while. He suggested to steer the problem according to your interest)</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Suggestions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Should be a balance between theoretical and practical work.</p></li>
<li><p>Originality should be encouraged.</p></li>
<li><p>Maths dept should be bigger!</p></li>
<li><p>There should be more intra/inter department interaction.</p></li>
<li><p>Social interaction with faculty/guide.</p></li>
<li><p>Crash courses by PhD students within and outside dept.</p></li>
<li><p>More interaction with external world (It was suggested that they should also teach in engineering colleges. It will help them to learn and also to earn some money.).</p></li>
<li><p>How to make all students flourish simultaneously? (He generalized some other suggestion)</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Mentoring should be its own reward (He strongly emphasized on it).</li>
</ul>


<p>It was surprising no-one complain about the amount of money they are getting during their Ph.D.. This is a major concerns shown by students who leave India for higher studies (I myself has heard students saying it many times). I am not sure money is the only thing they will miss if they remain they India. But they like to point it out forcefully.</p>

<p>At the end, he asked student to write small autobiography to be submitted in the next meeting. This autobiography will be confidential. He stressed that autobiography should contain likes and dislikes and strengths and weaknesses as perceived by students.</p>

<p>He also asked students to come prepared with their topics (where applicable) and present to smaller groups first (5- 10 minute presentations) say 10 in each group (60-70 mins). They must cut out jargon so that talk should be understandable to an educated layman.</p>
