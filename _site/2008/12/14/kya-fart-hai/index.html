<p>Uff.. this is the placement time. First phase is over and I am jobless. I wrote all the tests and gave all the stupid interviews. Interviews, to those guys ..  I dont like them. Neither I want to be like them.. They asked all the standard and diplomatic question and I answered all honestly. Not with complete honesty.. otherwise they'd have thrown me out. But I want a job.. well paid so I can pay back my load asap and go on to do my doctorate. Now, it seems It may take 2 years to pay back it.. and I am tense.. First I have to do the things I dont like. Now GATE is valid only for 1 year. This year score wont work next year.. what a crap!!</p>

<p>I dont like giving exams and the worst is giving interviews to the people I dont wanna be. What a stupid life.. Due to all of these, I didnt write TIFR exam for doctorate. :-(</p>

<p>Now mamma is insisting joining DRDO/ISRO and dad is whatever is respectful. Younger brother wants to me to join the highest paid one and my elder brother wants me to know my girlfriend name. hmmmmm..</p>

<p>Tomorrow one more test and interview.. ahh.. I dont want to go.. Ok.. I have to be.. though I have choices but I am not comfortable to make them.. I have to go for a job. After I am done with the loan .. :-) I dont give a damn.. what anyone thinks .. anyone means my family.. others do not matter !!</p>

<p>ok.. blah blah is over.. Its took me 20 years to kill the inferior feelings. Now after this placement spree, this has started germinating once again. I dont want it. Its really harmful!! gotta protect myself!! :-) lets see....</p>

<p>I am getting addicted to X-files and Ubuntu... linux is wonderful and Windows is as stupid.. hehe</p>

<p>Jyoti is wondering why i didn't get the job on the very first day. Boka was being boka.. telling why did I join IIT. Cancer is asking me to go to US for doctorate AS IT'D SOLVE ALL OF MY PROBS. good scholarship.. pay back my loan and all... I want to join TIFR,CMI or IMSc.. actually .. i wanna doctorate here.. Now I dont want to go anywhere. I consumed resources here, I'll compensate them too here. Its not patriotism or something. it's all belief. unfortunately, I have to be someone whom I never wanna be for a year or so. All I wish I dont lay off my eyes on the things I always wanted to have. These days I am not even writing my diary.. Things are bit disturbing these days. :-(</p>
