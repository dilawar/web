        <div class="entry"><p>I just love the concept of feedback, negative in particular. It makes lifestable and every system whatsoever. Its just not about system engineering or anyother discipline, it is pervasive in every aspect of your life and mine too, ofcourse. Consider a simple example, quite interesting and relevant, a girl and aboy fall in love with each other, they started giving compliments to each other,giving each other best of their criticism.  Thats nothing but a positivefeedback. I can not draw a figure here, otherwise it could be more lucid. Now,one starts loving other more, that in itself is positive feedback, its increasethe love of the other person for the first one. Here we got a loop, just like incase of astable multi-vibrator. This 'love-system' now reaches its maximum valueafter a time when the response of each person saturates. This is due to themental and physical capabilities of the each individuals. You don't have to beKurt Godel to figure out that when a system is running at its full capacity, itbound to be collapsed. The time it takes to collapse depends on the variousaspects of the individuals, these aspects, lets call them components of thesystem. Maturity, level of compromising nature, level of ego, etc could betermed as the characteristics of these components which sets the time limit ofthis collapse. But for sure, it will collapse. That what happen in the lovemarriages where there a loop is established of positive nature. For sustaining arelationship, there is a vital need of negative feedback, though it induce manyparameters which in turn degrade short term performance. Initially it mayfacilitate large settling time ( which in our system of interest is strength ofrelationship) if feedback coefficient is high. So make sure, negative feedbackcoefficient should be small enough, otherwise your system is not going to givethe desired output, and hence no question of stability. Well i have to perfectthis theory, right now i am feeling hungry, gotta go for dinner.<br/>
This theory can be applied to homosexual too. I am not sex biased!<br/>
Don't forget to give your "negative feedback" about this blog.</p>

<p>Thanks...</p>
